//! Host services an app reaches by exact name: `matrix.*` for the person's
//! Matrix account (Rinx) and `octos.*` for the device's assistant.
//!
//! These names are the published contract between a bundle and every host
//! that runs it. A host admits a bundle only when each requested name is in
//! [`crate::KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`] exactly; a prefix is never a grant, so
//! `octos.` or `octos.admin` is an unknown capability. Admission is not
//! dispatch either: the host still intersects the declaration with the
//! services it supports, its own policy and the person's per-instance grant,
//! and checks the resulting lease on every request. Reading assistant
//! history does not imply starting a turn; each service is its own consent.
//!
//! The assistant's model provider, credentials and kernel belong to the host.
//! No `octos.*` service lets an app choose a provider, submit a key or reach
//! the kernel's raw protocol.
