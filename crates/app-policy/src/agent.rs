//! An app's own agent, as its bundle ships it (ADR 0002 §3, §4, §12).
//!
//! Next to `manifest.json` a contained app may ship:
//!
//! - [`TOOLS_FILE`] (`tools.json`): its tool manifest. Each tool is named in
//!   the app's namespace (`news.list`), typed with a small JSON Schema subset
//!   for its input and output, and carries a risk level (read, act,
//!   destructive) and whether it may run in the background or be shared with
//!   other callers. The shell registers exactly these with the app's peer.
//! - [`AGENT_FILE`] (`AGENT.md`): the agent's instructions, named by
//!   `agent.instructions`.
//! - `skills/<name>/{SKILL.md,manifest.json}`: octos skills, named by
//!   `agent.skills`, installed into this app's peer workspace only. For a
//!   contained app they are data-only: a skill manifest that declares
//!   executables, MCP servers or hooks is refused, and a skill may use only
//!   tools the app already has.
//!
//! `tools.json` is the one tool manifest for every app, contained or native.
//! A contained app ships it in its bundle, and the gate checks it here. A
//! native module ships the same file as a module resource, pinned by the
//! shell build; the app-peers broker (OctoSense `crates/app-peers`) loads it
//! with [`ToolManifest::load`] under [`ToolHost::Native`] and builds its
//! `ToolDef`s from it, so Rust only implements executors keyed by tool name.
//! The parser and validator make no assumption about bundles or the Card
//! runner. The risk vocabulary is the broker's ([`Risk::broker_name`]).
//!
//! Every file is under the bundle digest like the rest of the app, so what
//! was reviewed is what runs. [`review`] is what the gate runs over a bundle
//! directory; [`AgentBundle::load`] is what a shell calls on an installed
//! (unpacked) bundle, and refuses anything [`review`] refuses, plus a digest
//! that does not match.
