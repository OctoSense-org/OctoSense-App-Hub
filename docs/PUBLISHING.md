The gate is the Hub's admission check. Run it yourself with `hub check`: it
reports each broken rule as a refusal or a warning. A pass does not show that
the app renders, that its icon reads at small sizes or that its listing is
true. Reviewers check those
([What reviewers check](SUBMITTING.md#8-what-reviewers-check)).

## Current source policy: declarations and authorization

`capabilities` and `network.hosts` describe an app's expected API and network
use for users and reviewers. Omitting a family or destination does not deny
an otherwise supported public API. This is the source policy being prepared
for the next compatible release; historical RC2 behavior is not evidence of
this change being deployed.

Every admitted app gets a private storage jail with the resolved quota and a
network module. Device access still needs per-app consent and OS permission;
connected accounts keep app/account ownership and provider scopes. External
writes retain native review, agents retain opt-in and reviewed tools, and
other apps' data/tools still require sharing authorization. Internal host
profile data and unowned `agent.notify` are not public APIs.

`requires` and `host_api.required` remain compatibility checks, not capability
permissions. Component ABI/import validation, exact digests, publisher proof,
catalog withdrawal, quotas and supported platforms remain enforced. Missing
usage declarations may produce review warnings. `AppPolicy::allows` and
`allows_host` are legacy declaration queries; hosts must not use them as
execution authorization. Use `runtime.list` / `runtime.describe` to discover
actual methods and their platform/consent requirements.

## What an app is

A bundle is a directory of text and artwork. A **host** runs it: the OctoSense
shell (the desktop or phone app) or `card-host`. Each app runs in an
**isolate**, a sandboxed script runtime of its own, under its **policy**: only
its own storage boundary, resource ceilings and host consent checks. A bundle holds no native code.
An app that needs new native code ships inside a shell release instead
([Choose a delivery path](DEVELOPMENT.md#choose-a-delivery-path)).

The entry file decides the kind of app:

| Kind | Entry | Runs as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Script app | `main.splash` at the bundle root | A program in Splash, Makepad's UI script language, with its own state, handlers, storage and requests. |
| Card app | `page.card` at the bundle root | A card in L0, OctoSense's declarative card language, which the host renders as widgets. It holds no logic. |

A bundle with both entry files is a script app.

A script app's bundle holds these files:

```text
my-app/
  manifest.json      what the app is and what it may do       (required)
  listing.json       what the store shows about it             (required)
  main.splash        the program                               (required)
  assets/            the icon and other local artwork          (icon required)
  screenshots/       at least one PNG or SVG the listing names (required)
```

Build a script app with App Flow's
[script-app flow](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/flows/script-app/FLOW.md)
and [Script API](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/docs/SCRIPT-API.md), starting from its
[`templates/script-app/`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/tree/main/templates/script-app).

Name the bundle's own artwork through the `{{assets}}` placeholder, for example
`http_resource("{{assets}}/assets/logo.png")`. The host replaces the
placeholder with a loopback origin that serves this bundle and nothing else.

The first-party [system apps](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/tree/main/apps)
(`apps/<name>/bundle/`) are complete examples. Their `os.` ids are reserved,
so a copy needs an id of its own.

A card app's bundle holds these files:

```text
my-app/
  manifest.json      what the app is and what it may do       (required)
  listing.json       what the store shows about it             (required)
  page.card          the L0 card, the app's screen             (required)
  page.data.json     the data bound into the card              (optional)
  kit/               the widget kit that renders the card      (required)
  assets/            the icon and other local artwork          (icon required)
  screenshots/       at least one PNG or SVG the listing names (required)
```

Produce the card, its data and its kit with App Flow's
[image-to-card flow](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/flows/image-to-card/FLOW.md).
The [L0 specification](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/blob/main/apps/appcard/a2app-l0/framework/l0.md)
defines the card language.

Either kind may also ship its own agent next to `manifest.json`: `tools.json`,
`AGENT.md` and `skills/<name>/`
([The app's agent and tools](#the-apps-agent-and-tools)).

You submit only the bundle. Keep developer instructions, source tools, keys,
test data and review packets outside it
([Lay out the repository](SUBMITTING.md#1-lay-out-the-repository)).

## Rules the gate enforces

`hub check` runs in two stages: the structural limits first, then every other
rule.

### Structural limits

A bundle that breaks a structural limit gets no report. `hub check` prints a
single line, `hub: <reason>`, and exits 1. With `--json` it reports the same
reason as one refusal under the check name `bundle-invalid`.

| Limit | Reason printed |
| --- | --- |
| At most 8 MiB (8,388,608 bytes) of files, not counting `manifest.json` | `the bundle exceeds the size limit` |
| At most 2048 files and directories | `the bundle exceeds the file count limit` |
| Nesting at most 32 directories deep | `the bundle exceeds the directory depth limit` |
| A `manifest.json` at the bundle root, at most 64 KiB | `<bundle>/manifest.json: No such file or directory (os error 2)`, `manifest.json exceeds the size limit` |
| Regular files and directories only, no symlinks | `<path>: only regular files and directories are allowed` |
| Portable paths: UTF-8 names with no `\` or `:`, and no empty, `.` or `..` segment | `not a portable bundle path: "<path>"` |
| A manifest that parses: no unknown field or value, `schema` 1, every `requires` feature known | `manifest is not valid: …`, `manifest schema <n> is not 1`, `app <id> needs a newer host: …` |

### Findings

Every other broken rule adds a report line, a **finding**, that names its
check: `[refused] <check> (<path>): <detail>` or `[warning] <check>: <detail>`.
`(<path>)` appears only when one file or property is at fault. A refusal stops
admission. A warning does not.

| Check | Refused when | Warned when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `digest` | `integrity.bundle_blake3` does not match the bundle. Restamp the editable source after edits; a sealed GitHub release needs a new proof. | |
| `publisher-signature` | The declared GitHub proof fails verification, even with `--allow-unsigned`; the manifest is unsigned and `--allow-unsigned` is absent; or a legacy Ed25519 signature fails verification or names an unknown key (`publisher key "<id>" is not registered with this hub`). | The manifest is unsigned and `--allow-unsigned` is given. |
| `identity` | The id starts with `os.`; the id, or its last segment, is a reserved name ([Ids and reserved names](#ids-and-reserved-names)). | |
| `contents` | A file's extension is not one of `.card`, `.json`, `.l0`, `.octoscript`, `.splash`, `.svg`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.txt` or `.md`, and it is not a function module (`.wasm`, see `functions`). Files with no extension, such as `.DS_Store` and `LICENSE`, are refused too. | |
| `functions` | The bundle carries more than 8 `.wasm` files in `fns/`. A `.wasm` file that is not at `fns/<name>.wasm` (the name `[a-z0-9_-]`, at most 64 characters) or `components/<blake3>.wasm` (named by its own digest, see `components`), or is neither a WebAssembly core module (the 8-byte header of version 1) nor a valid component, is refused as `contents-invalid`, as is a component that imports anything outside `wasi:cli`, `wasi:clocks`, `wasi:filesystem`, `wasi:http`, `wasi:io`, `wasi:random` and `octosense:host`. A component is refused here when the manifest does not require `wasm-components-v1` ([WebAssembly components](#webassembly-components)). The gate checks nothing else inside a core module; the host checks its imports and exports when it loads the module. | The app declares `wasm` but carries no `fns/*.wasm` and names no shared component. The manifest requires `wasm-components-v1` but `fns/` holds no component. Each admitted component gets a line saying what it reaches. Bundled functions without a `wasm` disclosure, or component file/HTTP imports without `storage`/`net` disclosures, produce warnings, not refusals. |
| `components` | A shared component the manifest names is missing from the `--catalog` catalog, withdrawn there or has another digest, or its imports are unsupported. A store app's bundle carries a `.wasm` file in `components/`. A system app's bundle (`--system-app`) lacks `components/<blake3>.wasm` for a component it pins, or carries one it does not pin ([Shared components](#shared-components)). | Each resolved component gets a line saying what it reaches. Without `--catalog`, each component is reported as not resolved. The manifest requires `wasm-shared-components-v1` but names no components. |
| `contents-invalid` (text and images) | A text file (`.splash`, `.card`, `.json`, `.l0`, `.octoscript`, `.txt` or `.md`) is over 1 MiB or not UTF-8; JSON does not parse; a PNG, JPEG or WebP does not decode or is over 4096 px a side; the listing icon is not square, or is a bitmap over 1 MiB or 1024 px a side. | |
| `contents-invalid` (SVG) | An SVG does not parse; lacks a numeric `width` and `height` or a `viewBox`; is over 4096 px a side; or holds a script, a `foreignObject` or an `on…` handler. Its styling (a `style` attribute or a `<style>` block) imports a stylesheet, uses an escape, uses a comment or points `url()` anywhere but a `#fragment` in the same file. | |
| `entry` | The bundle has neither `main.splash` nor `page.card`; `page.card` is not valid L0; `page.data.json` is not JSON; neither `kit/native/<theme>/kit.json` nor every OctoScript kit module the card needs is in the bundle. | |
| `resource-invalid` | A card's image or font reference, or an SVG `href`, names a file that is not in the bundle. The finding names the JSON pointer. See [Fonts](#fonts). | |
| `assets` | A `.card`, `.json`, `.l0` or `.octoscript` file other than `manifest.json`, `listing.json` and the agent files contains `http://`, `https://`, `file://` or `../`. Plain documentation links are not asset loads. A `.splash` file or an agent file contains `http://`, `file://`, `../`. Missing `network.hosts` entries do not cause refusal. | |
| `secrets` | A `.card`, `.l0`, `.octoscript` or `.splash` file declares `is_password: true` or a `TextInputContentType` of `Password`, `NewPassword` or `OneTimeCode`. | |
| `storage` | | A `.splash` file calls `fs.*`, or the app requests `camera`, without the `storage` disclosure. The `declarations:` line still reports the bounded storage quota. |
| `listing` | `listing.json` is missing or breaks a rule in [The listing](#the-listing); the listing names no screenshot or no icon; it names a screenshot or icon that is not in the bundle. | |
| `tools`, `agent`, `skills` | `tools.json`, `AGENT.md` or a skill breaks a rule in [Rules for agent files](#rules-for-agent-files). | A tool is destructive or outward (each call waits for approval); a tool says `confirm: "app"`; the app declares tools but `agent.model.needs` omits `tool_calling`; a background agent has destructive tools. |
| `policy` | A capability is unknown; the id breaks a rule in [Ids and reserved names](#ids-and-reserved-names); the version is empty; a host is not a bare host name, ([Network hosts](#network-hosts)); the `research` scope or an `agent` field breaks its rules; `storage.cache_max_bytes` is 0. | |
| `version` (with `--catalog`) | The catalog already holds this version of the app. | |
| `continuity` (with `--catalog`) | A rule in [Publisher continuity](#publisher-continuity) is broken, or the catalog history disagrees with itself. | |

### Fonts

A card names a font with `font_src`, in the `page.data.json` placements or in
a native kit's component styles. The gate accepts a font file in the bundle,
or one of these exact built-in resource names from the pinned runtime:

```text
makepad_widgets:resources/Inter.ttf
makepad_widgets:resources/LXGWWenKaiRegular.ttf
makepad_widgets:resources/LXGWWenKaiBold.ttf
```

Use a bundle-relative path such as `"font_src": "assets/Body.ttf"` for a
bundled `.ttf` or `.otf`. The installed card runner and `card-host` evaluate
kit styles and font tokens first, then resolve the path and load the file
from the bundle's host-owned asset server. Keep HTTP URLs out of the bundle;
neither a network grant nor an external font URL is needed.

In a native kit, `font_src` may also be one token reference,
`{"$token": "<name>"}`, whose `value` in the kit's `tokens` is such a path. The
gate checks the path that the token resolves to. Any other object, or an
array, is refused with
`font_src must be a bundled font path, a supported built-in font, or one token resolving to a string`.

Other built-in names and crate paths are refused. Bundle a licensed font
subset when it is not one of these shipped resources.

Keep the font's required license and attribution with the bundle. Links in
plain `.txt` and `.md` documentation are not asset loads and grant no network
access. Agent instructions, skills and scripts reject unsafe references
(`http://`, `file://`, `../`); their HTTPS links do not require a matching
`network.hosts` entry. Card data and SVG resources retain their stricter
resource checks.

A bundled font counts toward the 8 MiB limit, so bundle a subset of a large
CJK font. The gate checks the font's path but does not decode the file, so
test the complete bundle in `card-host`. A host built with Makepad's
International font set, such as `card-host`, also draws Chinese with a
built-in CJK fallback font that it loads on first use.

OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2 predates bundled-font loading: it installs an
app with a bundled font, but its cards do not load the font. For Chinese text
on that release, build the card from the role kit and set no `font_src`. The
role kit is the OctoScript module set behind `Surface`, `TextTitle` and
`TextBody`: copy `_kit.octoscript`, `_derive.octoscript`,
`_derive_color.octoscript`, `_palette_light.octoscript` and
`_palette_dark.octoscript` from OctoScript-Makepad's `components/l0/` into the
bundle's `kit/`. It draws Chinese with Makepad's built-in CJK face, LXGW
WenKai.

By default, Makepad draws a glyph that the card's fonts lack with one of the
operating system's fonts, so on macOS a missing font can go unnoticed. Turn
that fallback off when you check a card:

```sh
MAKEPAD_SYSTEM_FONTS=0 tools/octo run ~/apps/my-app/bundle --port 8141 --detach
```

Each glyph that neither the card's fonts nor the renderer's fallback covers now
draws as a box.

A script app can bundle a font. Name the file through the `{{assets}}`
placeholder in a text style's `FontMember`; it counts toward the 8 MiB limit:

```splash
Label{text: "Hello" draw_text.text_style: TextStyle{font_family: FontFamily{latin := FontMember{res: http_resource("{{assets}}/fonts/<file>.ttf") asc: 0.0 desc: 0.0}} font_size: 20}}
```

Unverified: how the OctoSense shells draw these fonts.

### WebAssembly components

A file in `fns/` may be a WebAssembly **component** instead of a core module:
an ordinary Rust crate built with `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2`
([OctoSense ADR 0014](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/436),
proposed). Its functions take and return typed values, keep their state
between calls and may use part of WASI. OctoSense #453 merged component
loading and its HTTP/host-service adapters. A compatible downloadable host
and acceptance of the exact app are separate; RC2 runs core modules only.

The gate admits a component when:

- the manifest requires `wasm-components-v1`. A host that does not implement
  that ABI refuses the app before launch;
- it validates and imports interfaces only from `wasi:cli`, `wasi:clocks`,
  `wasi:filesystem`, `wasi:http`, `wasi:io`, `wasi:random` and
  `octosense:host`. A type the component defines, such as a record one of its
  functions returns, does not count as an import. `wasi:sockets` and anything
  else are refused as `contents-invalid`;
- `wasi:filesystem` stays in the app's own storage jail and quota;
- `wasi:http` uses the host's supported network transport. `net` and
  `network.hosts` describe usage, not a runtime allowlist;
- `octosense:host` routes as the owning app with actual consent, account and
  sharing checks. It cannot raise a foreground approval from a component.

A component follows a module's name and size rules and counts toward the 8
function files. Each admitted component gets a warning that tells a reviewer
what it reaches:

```text
[warning] functions (fns/notes.wasm): fns/notes.wasm is a component that reaches the clock, random numbers and files in its app folder, but no network or other app
```

A component that imports `wasi:http` (here App Hub's `fetch` fixture, in an
app with `net` and no `network.hosts`) gets:

```text
[warning] functions (fns/fetch.wasm): fns/fetch.wasm is a component that reaches the clock and the network, but no files or other app
```

Without `net`, the gate warns about incomplete disclosure:

```text
[warning] functions: fns/fetch.wasm imports wasi:http; disclose net usage
```

A component that imports `octosense:host` (App Hub's `hostcall` fixture, in
an app with only `wasm`) gets:

```text
[warning] functions (fns/hostcall.wasm): fns/hostcall.wasm is a component that reaches the clock and its app's host services, but no files, network or other app
```

### The crates a component lists

A component may say which crates it is built from, in a custom section named
`octosense-crates`: JSON `{"schema": 1, "crates": [{"name", "version",
"source", "checksum"}]}`, with `source` `crates.io`, `git+<url>#<commit>` or
`path`. App Flow's `tools/octo wasm build` writes it, and so does App Flow's
release workflow, which builds the component from the tagged commit and takes
the list from its `Cargo.lock`, so GitHub attests both. It lists only what the
binary links: build scripts' and procedural macros' crates are left out. The
gate cannot check the list against the code: it shows it to reviewers. This
is the notes component with the list App Flow writes for it:

```text
[warning] functions (fns/notes.wasm): fns/notes.wasm is built from 8 crates: bitflags 2.13.2, cfg-if 1.0.5, getrandom 0.4.3, memchr 2.8.3, pulldown-cmark 0.13.4, pulldown-cmark-escape 0.11.0, unicase 2.10.0 and wit-bindgen 0.62.0
```

A component without the section is admitted, with:

```text
[warning] functions (fns/hostcall.wasm): fns/hostcall.wasm does not list the crates it is built from (its octosense-crates section); tools/octo wasm build and App Flow's release workflow add it
```

Two such sections, or one that is not a crate list, are refused as
`contents-invalid`. `hub check <bundle> --advisory-db <dir>`, with `<dir>` a
checkout of [RustSec's advisory database](https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db),
also reports every listed crates.io crate that an advisory affects. These
lines are from a component listing two old crates, checked against the
database as of 9 October 2026:

```text
[warning] advisories (fns/notes.wasm): fns/notes.wasm includes smallvec 0.6.9, which RUSTSEC-2019-0009 reports as a vulnerability: Double-free and use-after-free in SmallVec::grow(); fixed in >= 0.6.10
[warning] advisories (fns/notes.wasm): fns/notes.wasm includes time 0.1.43, which RUSTSEC-2020-0071 reports as a vulnerability: Potential segfault in the time crate; fixed in >= 0.2.23
```

An informational advisory (unmaintained, unsound) is reported as one, and a
withdrawn one not at all. The gate does not fetch the database itself.

`hub component-info <file.wasm>` prints what a function file is (`component`
or `module`), its imports and its exported functions, each with its parameters
and result as WIT writes them. Here it runs in a bundle whose
`fns/notes.wasm` is the notes component from App Hub's tests
(`crates/app-hub/tests/fixtures/notes.component.wasm`), with the output
shortened at `…`:

```console
$ hub component-info fns/notes.wasm
{
  "kind": "component",
  "imports": [
    "wasi:io/poll@0.2.9",
    "wasi:clocks/monotonic-clock@0.2.9",
    …
    "wasi:filesystem/preopens@0.2.9",
    "wasi:random/insecure-seed@0.2.9"
  ],
  "exports": [
    {
      "name": "analyze",
      "params": [
        [
          "markdown",
          "string"
        ]
      ],
      "result": "record { words: u32, lines: u32, headings: list<string> }"
    },
    …
  ]
}
```

For a core module it prints `"kind": "module"`, its imports as `module.name`
and its exported functions with their core types, the parameters named `p0`,
`p1` and so on.

The [`host_method` rules](#map-a-tool-to-a-shared-service-host_method) for a
`wasm.<function>` tool were written for core modules, whose functions see only
their input. They apply to components unchanged for now, although a component
with `storage` can read the app's files.

## Shared components

A **shared component** is a WebAssembly component that App Hub publishes in
its catalog on its own, so that several apps can use it, as npm packages are
shared. Unlike an npm dependency, it is pinned exactly: an app names one
exact version and the file's BLAKE3 digest, so an installed app's code never
changes without an app update
([ADR 0003](adr/0003-shared-components.md), phase 4 of
[OctoSense ADR 0014](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/436)).
App Hub reviews a shared component like an app and validates it like an
app's own component ([WebAssembly components](#webassembly-components)).
It reaches only what the app that uses it may: each app runs its own
instance, under its own identity, resource limits and actual authorization.

Shared components require a compatible host and publication in its verified
catalog; ordinary component loading alone does not supply that support.
Hosts built before shared components, OctoSense desktop RC1 and RC2 among
them, refuse a whole catalog that holds a component or an app that pins one,
so App Hub publishes neither until a compatible host release ships.

### Use a shared component

Name each component in the manifest's `components`, and require
`wasm-shared-components-v1`; the capabilities below disclose usage:

```json
"capabilities": ["wasm", "storage"],
"requires": ["wasm-shared-components-v1"],
"components": [
  {
    "as": "markdown",
    "id": "org.example.markdown",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "blake3": "c30d6e3125ff31676cad3c06735186d82cd0c017802afd344e3d2db876ff976c"
  }
]
```

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `as` | The app's name for the component: `[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,31}`, unique in the manifest. |
| `id` | The component's id in the catalog. |
| `version` | One exact semantic version, such as `1.0.0` or `1.0.0-rc.1`. A range such as `^1.0.0` is refused. |
| `blake3` | The component file's BLAKE3 digest, 64 lowercase hex characters: the catalog entry's `wasm_blake3`. |

An app names at most 8 components. The manifest parser refuses `components`
without the feature (`components requires wasm-shared-components-v1`)
and an entry that breaks a rule above. A host that does not know
the feature refuses the app. An app that uses only shared components needs no
`fns/`.

With `--catalog`, the gate resolves each component in that catalog. The
`components` check refuses the app when a component is missing (`is not in
the catalog`), withdrawn (`was withdrawn: <reason>`) or has another digest
(`pins blake3 …, but the catalog's file hashes to …`). Missing `storage`,
`net` or `wasm` usage declarations do not refuse the component. Each component then
gets a line that says what it reaches in this app. Without `--catalog`, the
gate warns that it cannot resolve the components.

This rehearsal ran on a local development hub (see
[Rehearse with a development hub](#rehearse-with-a-development-hub)) whose
catalog offers `org.example.markdown` 1.0.0, the notes component from App
Hub's tests (`crates/app-hub/tests/fixtures/notes.component.wasm`). The app
`writer` pins it and discloses `wasm` and `storage` usage:

```console
$ hub check writer --allow-unsigned --catalog dev-catalog.json --anchor "$(cat anchor.pub)"
org.example.writer 1.0.0 — PASSED
  [warning] publisher-signature: unsigned: accountability rests on the hub alone
  [warning] components: component markdown (org.example.markdown 1.0.0) reaches the clock, random numbers and files in its app folder, but no network or other app
  declarations: capabilities {"storage", "wasm"}, hosts {}, storage 16777216 bytes, agent none
```

Without `storage`, the same app remains admissible and still receives its
private storage jail and quota. The component reach line informs reviewers.

Without `--catalog`:

```text
  [warning] components: component markdown (org.example.markdown 1.0.0) is not resolved: check with --catalog to see that it is offered, matches its digest and what it reaches
```

A store app's bundle never carries a component: the gate refuses a `.wasm`
file in `components/`, because the store fetches the components from the
catalog. A
shipped system app has no catalog. It carries each component it pins as
`components/<blake3>.wasm` in its bundle. `hub check --system-app` checks
that each of those files is a valid component with allowed imports, named by
its own digest, with supported imports. It refuses a file that the
manifest does not pin.

The store's permission lines for such an app add `Runs shared components App
Hub reviewed, with only this app's permissions: org.example.markdown 1.0.0`.

### Publish a shared component

A component release is two files: the component, built with
`cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2`, and `<id>-<version>.component.json`,
which describes it. You write a draft with the fields in the first table
below; `hub component-prepare` derives the rest from the file:

| You write | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `component.schema` | `1`. |
| `component.id` | The rules for an app id ([Ids and reserved names](#ids-and-reserved-names)); never `os.`, and not the id of an app in the catalog. |
| `component.version` | One exact semantic version. Every release is a new version, higher than the last one published. |
| `component.name` | 1 to 64 characters. |
| `component.publisher` | As a listing's `publisher` ([The listing](#the-listing)). |

| `hub component-prepare` writes | From |
| --- | --- |
| `component.wasm_blake3`, `component.bytes` | The file's BLAKE3 digest and size. |
| `component.imports`, `component.exports` | The file, as `hub component-info` lists them. |
| `component.integrity.github` | The GitHub identity flags, as for an app ([GitHub publisher provenance](#github-publisher-provenance)). Without them, the release is an unsigned development release. |

```console
$ hub component-prepare markdown.wasm --draft component.json --out markdown.component.json
{"bytes":310601,"id":"org.example.markdown","schema":1,"status":"unsigned-development-release","version":"1.0.0","wasm_blake3":"c30d6e3125ff31676cad3c06735186d82cd0c017802afd344e3d2db876ff976c"}
```

A release's GitHub workflow, in a public repository and on a
`v<version>` tag push as for an app, runs:

```sh
hub component-prepare target/wasm32-wasip2/release/markdown.wasm --draft component.json \
  --repository OWNER/REPO --repository-id REPOSITORY_ID --owner-id OWNER_ID \
  --workflow .github/workflows/publish-component.yml \
  --tag v1.0.0 --commit IMMUTABLE_GIT_SHA \
  --out build/octosense-component.json
# actions/attest attests exactly build/octosense-component.json.
hub component-pack build/octosense-component.json \
  --wasm target/wasm32-wasip2/release/markdown.wasm \
  --attestation build/component-attestation.sigstore.json --out build/release
```

`build/octosense-component.json` is the release in canonical JSON, without
its proof: the bytes the attestation covers. It carries the file's digest, so
the proof binds the file. Prepared with an example identity:

```console
$ hub component-prepare markdown.wasm --draft component.json --repository example-org/markdown --repository-id 123456789 --owner-id 987654321 --workflow .github/workflows/publish-component.yml --tag v1.0.0 --commit 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 --out build/octosense-component.json
{"bytes":310601,"id":"org.example.markdown","schema":1,"sha256":"ae2ff83c70842a4f8e2aa20de538a1ba94f3de76a85a5152e1bf7e716c0c5c34","status":"awaiting-github-attestation","subject":"octosense-component.json","version":"1.0.0","wasm_blake3":"c30d6e3125ff31676cad3c06735186d82cd0c017802afd344e3d2db876ff976c"}
```

`hub component-pack` attaches the proof, runs the gate and writes
`<id>-<version>.component.json` and `<id>-<version>.wasm` into a new
directory. Without a proof that verifies, it writes nothing:

```console
$ hub component-pack build/octosense-component.json --wasm markdown.wasm --out release
org.example.markdown 1.0.0 (component c30d6e3125ff31676cad3c06735186d82cd0c017802afd344e3d2db876ff976c) — REFUSED
  [refused] publisher-signature: publisher attestation is missing
  [warning] functions (org.example.markdown-1.0.0.wasm): org.example.markdown 1.0.0 is a component that reaches the clock, random numbers and files in its app folder, but no network or other app
hub: the component was refused
```

App Flow now includes the component publisher workflow. The CLI transcript
above is not a release attestation: reviewers must verify the real workflow
proof for the exact component descriptor and Wasm bytes.

Submit a component as you submit an app
([Submit an app to the App Hub](SUBMITTING.md)): open an issue with the
repository, tag, commit and the two release files. Reviewers run
`hub component-check`, the gate for a release and its file:

```console
$ hub component-check markdown.component.json --wasm markdown.wasm
org.example.markdown 1.0.0 (component c30d6e3125ff31676cad3c06735186d82cd0c017802afd344e3d2db876ff976c) — REFUSED
  [refused] publisher-signature: App Hub accepts only GitHub-attested component releases
  [warning] functions (org.example.markdown-1.0.0.wasm): org.example.markdown 1.0.0 is a component that reaches the clock, random numbers and files in its app folder, but no network or other app
hub: the component was refused
```

| Check | Refused when |
| --- | --- |
| `component` | A field in the tables above breaks its rule, or the release's imports or exports are not the file's. |
| `digest` | The file's BLAKE3 digest or size is not the release's. |
| `size` | The file is over 8 MiB. |
| `contents-invalid` | The file is not a valid component, or imports anything outside `wasi:cli`, `wasi:clocks`, `wasi:filesystem`, `wasi:http`, `wasi:io`, `wasi:random` and `octosense:host`. |
| `publisher-signature` | The release has no GitHub provenance (a warning with `--allow-unsigned`), or its proof fails. |
| `identity` (with `--catalog`) | An app in the catalog has the component's id. |
| `version` (with `--catalog`) | The catalog already holds this version. |
| `continuity` (with `--catalog`) | The repository, owner or workflow differs from the earlier versions', the version is not higher than the newest, or the history disagrees with itself. |

The `functions` warning tells reviewers which interfaces the component
imports. Admission validates compatible imports and exact pins; at runtime
the component keeps the calling app's identity, jail, quotas and actual
authorization.

An App Hub admin turns an approved release into a catalog candidate with
`hub component-entry <release.json> --wasm <file.wasm> --catalog <authenticated
catalog> --out <index.json>`, which requires GitHub provenance. The candidate
adds `artifacts/<id>-<version>.wasm` and
`index/components/<id>-<version>.json`
([GitHub-admin publication](GITHUB-PUBLISHING.md#prepare-the-reviewed-candidate)).
A withdrawal marks the entry withdrawn, with a reason, as for an app.

### Rehearse with a development hub

`hub component-publish` adds a component to a legacy-signed catalog, for a
local rehearsal with throwaway keys. App Hub's own catalog is published only
through the GitHub-admin flow:

```console
$ hub keygen anchor.key > anchor.pub
$ hub keygen working.key > working.pub
$ hub certify --anchor anchor.key --working working.key > working.cert
$ hub component-publish markdown.component.json --wasm markdown.wasm --catalog dev-catalog.json --key working.key --anchor-cert "$(cat working.cert)" --publisher dev:example-org --out dev-hub --allow-unsigned
org.example.markdown 1.0.0 (component c30d6e3125ff31676cad3c06735186d82cd0c017802afd344e3d2db876ff976c) — PASSED
  [warning] publisher-signature: unsigned: accountability rests on the hub alone
  [warning] functions (org.example.markdown-1.0.0.wasm): org.example.markdown 1.0.0 is a component that reaches the clock, random numbers and files in its app folder, but no network or other app
published component org.example.markdown 1.0.0 (catalog sequence 1)
```

`hub withdraw` withdraws a component as it withdraws an app, and an app that
pins it is then refused:

```console
$ hub withdraw org.example.markdown --version 1.0.0 --reason "Renders raw HTML it should escape" --catalog dev-catalog.json --key working.key --anchor-cert "$(cat working.cert)"
withdrew org.example.markdown 1.0.0: Renders raw HTML it should escape (catalog sequence 2)
$ hub check writer --allow-unsigned --catalog dev-catalog.json --anchor "$(cat anchor.pub)"
org.example.writer 1.0.0 — REFUSED
  [warning] publisher-signature: unsigned: accountability rests on the hub alone
  [refused] components: component markdown (org.example.markdown 1.0.0) was withdrawn: Renders raw HTML it should escape
  declarations: capabilities {"storage", "wasm"}, hosts {}, storage 16777216 bytes, agent none
hub: the bundle was refused
```

### On the device

- **Install and update.** Before it installs or updates the app, the store
  resolves each component from the same verified catalog. It fetches the
  component's `artifacts/<id>-<version>.wasm` from the Hub, as it fetches the
  app's bundle, and checks its size, digest and validity. It keeps each digest
  once, read-only, at `<apps root>/.components/<blake3>.wasm`; an app is never
  installed without its components.
- **Launch.** Each launch checks the app's components with its bundle. A
  missing, changed or withdrawn component stops the app until the person
  updates or reinstalls it.
- **Uninstall.** Removing an app through the store (`Store::remove`), and
  each install or update through it, removes the components that no
  installed app pins any more.
- **Hosts.** A host's `wasm` service loads an app's components with
  `octosense_appstore::components::resolved(app_id)`, which returns each
  component's name, id, version, digest and verified file. It verifies every
  file on every call. A system app's components come from its own bundle.

**Acceptance boundary:** the admission/catalog fixtures in this guide do not
prove that a final released host installs and runs a particular component app.
Validate its exact build, platform and released bytes separately.

## The manifest

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "id": "com.example.forecast",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "Forecast",
  "integrity": { "bundle_blake3": "<written by hub stamp>" },
  "capabilities": ["storage", "net"],
  "network": { "hosts": ["api.open-meteo.com"] },
  "storage": { "max_bytes": 1048576 },
  "compute": { "instruction_budget": 5000000, "memory_bytes": 33554432 }
}
```

| Field | Meaning | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema` | The manifest grammar. | `1`. |
| `id` | The app's identity. It names the app's storage folder, and its last segment is the namespace of the app's tools. | See [Ids and reserved names](#ids-and-reserved-names). Keep it the same in every version. |
| `version` | This release. | Not empty. Use a new value for every release; a published version is never replaced. |
| `name` | What the person sees. | |
| `integrity.bundle_blake3` | The bundle's digest. | Written by `hub stamp`. Never edit it by hand. |
| `integrity.github` | GitHub repository/owner IDs, workflow, tag, commit and attached Sigstore proof. | Requires `publisher-github-v1`; generated by `publisher-prepare` and `publisher-attach`. |
| `integrity.signature` | `{key_id, value}`, a legacy Ed25519 signature over the manifest. | Leave it out: App Hub accepts only GitHub-attested releases ([Signing](#signing)). Until [App Hub #168](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/issues/168) lands, the gate still admits a key-signed manifest; reviewers refuse it. |
| `capabilities` | What the app expects to use. | Names from the closed list ([Capabilities](#capabilities)). |
| `network.hosts` | Expected network destinations, for disclosure. | Bare host names, validated even without `net` ([Network hosts](#network-hosts)). |
| `storage` | `max_bytes`, `accounts`, `agent_workspace`, `cache_max_bytes`. | See [Storage and quotas](#storage-and-quotas). |
| `compute` | `instruction_budget`, `memory_bytes`. | Clamped to the host's ceilings. |
| `agent` | The app's own agent. | Optional ([The manifest's `agent`](#the-manifests-agent)). |
| `research` | The scope of `research` and `crawl`. | Required when declaring `research` or `crawl`; a valid scope is also accepted without either declaration ([The research scope](#the-research-scope)). |
| `requires` | Host features the app needs. | Each must be a feature the host knows: `palpo-admin-v1`, `host-api-v1`, `backend-api-v1`, `script-tools-v1`, `publisher-github-v1`, `wasm-components-v1` or `wasm-shared-components-v1`. GitHub publishing requires a real provenance verifier; the three API markers also need a host that implements their APIs ([Host API compatibility](HOST-API.md)). `wasm-components-v1` and `wasm-shared-components-v1` identify required component ABIs ([WebAssembly components](#webassembly-components), [Shared components](#shared-components)). |
| `components` | The shared components the app's functions use, each pinned to one exact version and digest. | Optional; needs `wasm-shared-components-v1`; at most 8 ([Shared components](#shared-components)). |
| `host_api` | The host API methods the app needs (`required`) or can use (`optional`), each with its ABI major version. | Optional; needs `host-api-v1` in `requires`. The store checks the `required` methods at install and at every launch ([Declare what the app needs](HOST-API.md#declare-what-the-app-needs)). |
| `backend` | The app's own backend: its public sign-in endpoints and the operations the app may call. | Optional; needs `backend-api-v1` in `requires` and `storage.accounts: true`. Holds no credentials ([Sign in to your own backend](#sign-in-to-your-own-backend)). |
| `schema_minor` | Which additions to schema 1 the manifest uses. | Leave it out. |

Any other field is refused. After `hub publisher-prepare`, the manifest also
holds `null` for optional fields you left out, such as `"agent": null`. They
change nothing.

Declare expected usage accurately. The store labels these as disclosures;
omitted declarations do not prove that an app stores nothing or is offline.

### Capabilities

The gate knows 120 capability names: the 42 below and the 78 in
[Exact service names](#exact-service-names-octos-matrix-palpo). It refuses any
other name:

```text
[refused] policy: app com.example.forecast requests unknown capability "model.image"
```

A capability describes expected usage; it neither authorizes a request nor
provides a service to answer it. A **host service**, code in the OctoSense shell that does what the
app may not do itself, answers them. **Served today** says what answers on
[desktop RC2](../README.md#download-a-compatible-host), within its stated
platform and provider limits; RC1 and historical beta differences are explicit.

| Capability | Describes | The store says | Served today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `storage` | The app's own storage folder: `fs.*`, camera captures and local files a widget reads. The jail and quota also exist when this declaration is absent. | Keep its own data on this device | The runtime, in every host |
| `files` | Import and export files selected in the host's native dialog. Import/export uses the app jail; the app receives an app-relative file, never general filesystem access. Require the specific `files.*` methods the app uses. | Import and export files you choose in the system file dialog | Desktop RC2 on macOS and Windows, on Linux with a dialog helper (zenity, qarma, matedialog or kdialog), and compatible Android builds; absent from RC1. 1 MiB per file; `files.share` is Android-only and confirms only the chooser handoff |
| `net` | Direct network use; `network.hosts` lists expected destinations. | Declared destinations: *hosts* | The runtime, in every host |
| `images` | Pictures from any public https host, not only `network.hosts`. | Show pictures from any website | The runtime |
| `web` | Any public https page in the system web view, which has no way back into the app. | Open web pages in a browser view | The runtime on supported platforms, including Windows/WebView2 and Linux X11/XWayland/WebKitGTK since RC1; native Wayland embedding is unsupported ([requirements](../README.md#download-a-compatible-host)). |
| `location` | The device's location. On macOS since desktop RC1 and in compatible Android source builds, an app that declares `host-api-v1` must first ask with `location.permission.request`; it can then read a fresh fix with `location.sample` on macOS and Android (RC2), or the last-known fix with `location.get` on Android only ([Host API compatibility](HOST-API.md)). | Use your location | The runtime, where the device has it |
| `camera` | The camera. A capture is saved in the app's bounded private storage, even without a `storage` declaration. On macOS since desktop RC1 and in compatible Android source builds, an app that declares `host-api-v1` must first ask with `camera.permission.request`. | Use the camera | The runtime, where the device has it |
| `microphone` | Record sound after app and OS consent. Foreground `microphone.record_*` sessions arrive with desktop RC2 on macOS and compatible Android builds (clips of up to 30 seconds into the app's storage; hardware acceptance pending); earlier hosts, and Windows and Linux, expose permission methods without recording. Declare the exact required methods and first request `microphone.permission.request`. | Use the microphone | The runtime, where the device has it |
| `audio` | Play app-local audio while the app is active. Does not grant microphone consent or background recording. | Play its own audio files while the app is active | Desktop RC2 on macOS and compatible Android builds, with `storage` (files of at most 1 MiB and 60 seconds); not Windows, Linux or RC1; hardware acceptance pending. |
| `library` | Offering captures to the system photo library, where other apps can see them. | Save to your photo library, where other apps can see it | The runtime, where the device has it |
| `clipboard` | The clipboard. | Use the clipboard | Not yet: no API uses it |
| `prompt` | Questions the app asks the person. | Ask you questions | Not yet: no host reads it. An app agent asks with `ask_user_question`. |
| `ledger.read` | Reading the shared ledger. | Read your shared data | Not yet: no `ledger` service |
| `mail` | Mail through the host's `mail` service, from accounts the person signs in to on a host [sheet](#sheets-apps-never-collect-secrets). | Read and send mail from accounts you sign in to on the device | OctoSense. Since desktop RC2 a store app can also keep drafts (`mail.compose`) and request the native send review (`mail.review_send`), which approves only on macOS and Android ([Host API compatibility](HOST-API.md#reviewed-mail-drafts-desktop-rc2)) |
| `auth` | Connecting the app's own GitHub or Google accounts. Since OctoSense desktop RC1, also signing in to the app's own backend and calling the operations the manifest declares ([Sign in to your own backend](#sign-in-to-your-own-backend)). | Connect its own GitHub or Google accounts, or sign in to its developer’s backend, through the host | OctoSense, with OAuth client registrations on the host ([Connected accounts](#connected-accounts)) |
| `github` | Reading repositories; each Markdown commit waits for the person's review. | Read authorized repositories and ask you to review Markdown commits | As `auth` |
| `gcalendar` | Reading Google calendars; each event change waits for the person's review. | Read authorized Google calendars and ask you to review event changes | As `auth` |
| `gmail` | Reading Gmail and keeping reply drafts; each send waits for the person's review. Separate from `mail`. | Read authorized Gmail messages, keep reply drafts and request native send review | As `auth` |
| `calendar` | Calendar's local event store and UI. Not Google Calendar. | Read and manage local events through the device's Calendar service | System app `os.calendar` only; store apps use `gcalendar` |
| `device_calendar` | Read selected native device calendars and request review of event changes. Separate app consent, OS permission and calendar selection are required. | Read device calendars you choose and ask you to review event changes | Desktop RC2 on macOS (EventKit) and Android Home builds with the adapter; not Windows, Linux, RC1 or Home beta.1. Writes take a physical press; OS-calendar interaction is pending acceptance. Declare exact required methods. |
| `llm` | Managing the device's AI providers through the `llm` service. | Manage the assistant's AI providers, whose keys stay with the device | System apps only |
| `news` | Items the device collects from its feeds and topic feeds. | Read news the device collects from its feeds and topics | System apps only |
| `photos` | Photos' own library and collections. | Read Photos's own library and publish collections | System apps only: OctoSense serves just `photos.notify`, to `os.photos` |
| `youtube` | YouTube search and music recommendations. | Search YouTube and manage music recommendations | System apps only: OctoSense serves just `youtube.notify`, to `os.youtube` |
| `glance` | Publishing Glance cards to the Glance screen (`glance.publish`, `glance.withdraw`, `glance.list`). The host checks, caps and expires the cards; a card opens only its own app. | Show cards on your glance screen | OctoSense |
| `model` | `model.complete` and `model.budget`, within a daily budget per app. `model.complete` takes a model class (`fast` or `strong`) and a JSON Schema. Image, audio, video and embedding methods are implemented in [OctoSense #368](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/368), included since desktop RC1. | Send what you give it to the AI provider you configured, within a daily budget | OctoSense; media methods require the new implementation and a compatible configured provider |
| `research` | Searching through the system toolbox, within the manifest's research scope ([The research scope](#the-research-scope)). The host runs every search. | Search *what the scope allows* | System apps only, in phone builds |
| `crawl` | Crawling sites through the system toolbox, up to the scope's `max_depth` and `max_pages`, inside its domain lists. More reach than `research`. | Crawl websites, *within the scope*, which reaches more than searching | As `research` |
| `runtime` | Asking which APIs the host implements, with `runtime.list` and `runtime.describe` ([Host API compatibility](HOST-API.md)). It grants none of the APIs it lists. | Inspect available host APIs without gaining access to their data or permissions | Not on OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2, whose store refuses the name. App Hub's request dispatcher answers it in every host built from App Hub `main`, `card-host` included. |
| `wasm` | The app's own functions: WebAssembly core modules or components in the bundle's `fns/` (at most 8), run by the host's `wasm` service in a sandbox with a deadline and a memory cap. A core module's function gets only its input and reaches no file, network, clock or other app. A component may also read the clock and random numbers; the app's bounded private files; HTTP; and available public host services under the same actual authorization as its script. It reaches no other app ([WebAssembly components](#webassembly-components)). An agent tool can run one with `host_method: "wasm.<function>"`. To write, build and call a function, see App Flow's [Run your own Rust code](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/docs/RUST.md). | Run its own sandboxed functions on this device; they reach only what the app itself may | Desktop RC2 serves it in standard builds on macOS and Linux, with limited support ([the service and its limits](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/blob/main/docs/wasm.md#the-service)); RC1 left it disabled. Supported Android Home source builds serve it too. Current source includes Windows and OpenHarmony (Pulley), but excludes iOS; actual platform and release acceptance remain separate. Component source integration is merged in OctoSense #453. |
| `sheet` | Spreadsheets through the `sheet` engine (gridcraft): workbooks, formulas, recalculation and xlsx, inside the app's own files. | Use the device's spreadsheet engine on its own files | System apps only. Desktop RC2 includes the engine for the system assistant, but its admission code predates this capability name, so a store app must not declare it; OctoSense `main` serves it in desktop and Home builds. |
| `photo` | Images and photo documents through the `photo` engine (photocraft): inspect, convert, edit commands and previews, inside the app's own files. | Use the device's image-editing engine on its own files | System apps only. Desktop RC2 includes the engine for the system assistant, but its admission code predates this capability name, so a store app must not declare it; OctoSense `main` serves it in desktop and Home builds. |
| `word` | Documents through the `word` engine (wordcraft): create, read, inspect, and convert between docx, Markdown, HTML, RTF, ODT and PDF, inside the app's own files. | Use the device's document engine on its own files | System apps only. Desktop RC2 includes the engine for the system assistant, but its admission code predates this capability name, so a store app must not declare it; OctoSense `main` serves it in desktop builds (macOS, Linux, Windows), not in Home. |
| `deck` | Slide decks through the `deck` engine (deckcraft): create from an outline, render slides, and convert to PPTX or PDF, inside the app's own files. | Use the device's presentation engine on its own files | System apps only. Desktop RC2 includes the engine for the system assistant, but its admission code predates this capability name, so a store app must not declare it; OctoSense `main` serves it in desktop builds (macOS, Linux, Windows), not in Home. |
| `cad` | Drawings through the `cad` engine (cadcraft): inspect, query, measure, render, and convert DXF and DWG, inside the app's own files. | Use the device's CAD engine on its own files | System apps only. Desktop RC2 includes the engine for the system assistant, but its admission code predates this capability name, so a store app must not declare it; OctoSense `main` serves it in desktop builds (macOS, Linux, Windows), not in Home. |
| `light` | Raw photos through the `light` engine (lightcraft): metadata, develop controls, and single or batch develop, inside the app's own files. | Use the device's raw-photo engine on its own files | System apps only. Desktop RC2 includes the engine for the system assistant, but its admission code predates this capability name, so a store app must not declare it; OctoSense `main` serves it in desktop builds (macOS, Linux, Windows), not in Home. |
| `sound` | Audio files through the `sound` engine (soundcraft), offline: info, waveform peaks, convert, trim and mix; it never opens an audio device, inside the app's own files. | Use the device's audio-editing engine on its own files | System apps only. Desktop RC2 includes the engine for the system assistant, but its admission code predates this capability name, so a store app must not declare it; OctoSense `main` serves it in desktop builds (macOS, Linux, Windows), not in Home. |
| `design` | Page layouts through the `design` engine (designcraft): document info, page renders, and PDF, IDML or EPUB export, inside the app's own files. | Use the device's page-layout engine on its own files | System apps only.

| `pdf` | PDFs through the `pdf` engine (pdfcraft): info, text, page renders, merge and split, inside the app's own files. | Use the device's PDF engine on its own files | System apps only. Desktop RC2 includes the engine for the system assistant, but its admission code predates this capability name, so a store app must not declare it; OctoSense `main` serves it in desktop builds (macOS, Linux, Windows), not in Home. |

Declarations do not grant access or supply missing services. Not yet:
`photos` and `youtube` services for store apps. For how a script calls each capability, see App Flow's
[Capabilities](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/docs/CAPABILITIES.md); for which capabilities actually answer a
store app, on which platforms and since which release, its
[Host API families](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/docs/HOST-API-FAMILIES.md).

Source: `KNOWN_CAPABILITIES` in `crates/app-contract/src/manifest.rs`.

### Exact service names: `octos.*`, `matrix.*`, `palpo.*`

Each of these 78 names is a separate disclosure, matched exactly. A prefix
such as `octos.` or `matrix.` is an unknown capability. On the current
OctoSense host, an opted-in app assistant can use the four public `octos.*`
methods after the person consents, without declaring each method as a
capability. The host still checks the admitted app identity, session
ownership, method allowlist and consent. It does not create an assistant
merely because these methods exist, or grant another app's tools. Rinx
mini-app authorization is a separate hosting path.

| Group | Names | Describes | Served today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `octos.*` | 4: `octos.session.open`, `octos.session.history`, `octos.turn.start`, `octos.turn.interrupt` | A conversation with the app's own agent, run by octos, the agent kernel OctoSense runs: open it, read its history, start a turn, stop a turn the app started. The app never names a provider, a model or a key. | OctoSense, once the person allows the app's agent. Until then a call answers `Waiting for the person to allow this app's agent (OctoSense asks the first time)`. |
| `matrix.*` | 45, such as `matrix.read_messages`, `matrix.room_members`, `matrix.send_message` | One Matrix operation each, on the person's current account, in the rooms they allow. | No OctoSense host service serves them. Rinx, a native app OctoSense ships, serves them through its own host to the bundles a person imports into it as mini-apps; that is not the App Hub install path. |
| `palpo.*` | 29, such as `palpo.projects.list`, `palpo.inbox.decide` | One Palpo administration operation each. | Not yet: nothing in OctoSense serves them. |

Source: the store's words for each name are in
`crates/app-policy/src/services.rs` and `crates/app-contract/src/palpo.rs`.

### Ids and reserved names

An id is 1 to 64 characters of `[a-z0-9.-]`, does not start with `.` and never
contains `..`. The gate also refuses:

- **Every id under `os.`.** Those belong to system apps that ship with the
  device, and no store installs one.
- **An id that is a reserved name, or whose last segment is one.** The host
  keys an app's storage and consent by its id, and its tools by its namespace,
  so `com.example.notes` would stand in for the native Notes app. There are 23
  reserved names:

| Reserved because | Names |
| --- | --- |
| Apps OctoSense ships as native apps | `apphub`, `appcard`, `browser`, `calculator`, `clock`, `notes`, `octoscode`, `reference`, `reminders`, `rinx`, `sheets`, `task`, `terminal`, `weather` |
| Names the shell acts as or owns tools under | `agents`, `card`, `dev`, `octos`, `os`, `shell`, `system`, `toolbox`, `workflow` |

```text
[refused] identity: app id "com.example.notes" ends in "notes", which is reserved: its tools would be notes.*, a native app's or the host's
```

A system app's own namespace is not reserved: `com.example.news` is allowed.
An app that ships `tools.json` needs a namespace of `[a-z0-9_]{1,24}`:
`com.example.mynotes` can declare tools, and `com.example.my-notes` cannot.

Begin the id with a reverse-DNS prefix you control, such as your reversed
domain (`com.example` for `example.com`) or `io.github.<your-account>`; the
gate does not check that you control it.

Source: `RESERVED_NAMES` in `crates/app-contract/src/manifest.rs`.

### Network hosts

`network.hosts` lists expected destinations for disclosure. The runtime
network module is available even without `net` or a host list. Listed hosts
still need a valid disclosure format: bare host names with no scheme, path,
port or wildcard. This format rule does not restrict runtime destinations.

```text
[refused] policy: host "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1" must be a bare host name, with no scheme or path
```

The host list is part of each signed version, so list only stable hosts: a
published disclosure does not change when a tunnel gets a new name.
`localhost` is the person's own device, not your server.

### Storage and quotas

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `storage.max_bytes` | The storage the app requests, in bytes. |
| `storage.accounts` | `true` gives each account its own data folder and agent. The default is one `device` folder. |
| `storage.agent_workspace` | `"account"` (the default): the agent reads the account's folder. `"none"`: the agent reads no files and works only through its tools. |
| `storage.cache_max_bytes` | The space the app requests for `cache/`, in bytes; above 0. |
| `compute.instruction_budget` | Script instructions per session, cumulative. |
| `compute.memory_bytes` | The isolate's heap. |

Quotas are requests. The host clamps each one to its ceiling, the host's
maximum, and an absent value gets the ceiling. The `declarations:` line of
`hub check` shows the storage the app gets after clamping.

| Ceiling | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Storage | 16 MiB |
| Instructions per session | 20,000,000 |
| Heap | 64 MiB |

### The research scope

`research` and `crawl` share one scope, the manifest's top-level `research`
object. The gate checks it with octos's own rules, and the host hands the same
JSON to the system toolbox.

```json
{
  "capabilities": ["research", "crawl"],
  "research": {
    "langs": ["en", "zh"],
    "regions": ["US", "CN"],
    "domains_allow": [],
    "domains_deny": ["example-spam.com"],
    "max_age_days": 7,
    "categories": ["news"],
    "max_results": 20,
    "max_depth": 2,
    "max_pages": 20
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `langs` | BCP-47 languages the app may search in. | A language tag such as `en`, `zh-CN` or `zh-Hant`; `zh_cn` becomes `zh-CN`. |
| `regions` | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 regions. | Two letters; upper-cased. |
| `domains_allow` | Only these domains and their subdomains. | A bare domain: `example.com`, `.example.com` or `*.example.com`; no scheme, path or port. |
| `domains_deny` | Never these domains. | As above. |
| `max_age_days` | The oldest material, in days back from now. | A whole number of days. |
| `categories` | Metasearch categories. | `news`, `general`, `science`, `it` or `social`. |
| `max_results` | The most results per search. | Above 0; default 20. |
| `max_depth`, `max_pages` | The crawl limits: link depth and pages of one crawl. | Both above 0 when declaring `crawl`; otherwise they may be absent or 0 to disable crawling. A supplied scope is validated even without a `crawl` declaration. |

An empty or absent list, or an absent `max_age_days`, means no limit. `{}`
keeps only the defaults: 20 results a search and no crawl. Unknown fields are
refused.

The store shows the scope in plain words. For `research` with
`{"langs":["en","zh"],"categories":["news"],"max_age_days":7}`, the store's
privacy summary ([The listing](#the-listing)) says "Searches news in English
and Chinese, from the last 7 days".

## The app's agent and tools

An app can ship an agent of its own: its tools in `tools.json`, its
instructions in `AGENT.md` and data-only skills under `skills/`, declared by
the manifest's `agent` block. Every file is under the bundle digest, so the
agent that runs is the one that was reviewed. The store calls this agent the
app's assistant.

### The manifest's `agent`

```json
"agent": {
  "profile": "workspace-write-never-ask",
  "tools": [],
  "max_iterations": 8,
  "token_budget": 120000,
  "model": {
    "needs": ["tool_calling", "long_context"],
    "tier": "standard",
    "per_task": { "triage": { "needs": ["tool_calling"], "tier": "fast" } }
  },
  "background": true,
  "triggers": { "schedule": ["0 7 * * *", "0 19 * * *"], "events": ["news.items.new"] },
  "instructions": "AGENT.md",
  "skills": ["news-digest"]
}
```

| Field | Meaning | Refused when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `profile` | The agent session's permissions: `read-only` (every write asks first), `workspace-write` (reads and writes its workspace; anything else asks) or `workspace-write-never-ask` (the same, but anything else is refused without asking). No profile grants full access. | Any other value (`manifest is not valid`). |
| `tools` | Generic host tools (`ledger.read`, `ledger.write`, `net.fetch`, `storage.read`, `storage.write` and `card.render`) and one kernel tool, `ask_user_question`. The app's own tools come from `tools.json`; the agent gets both and nothing else. | A kernel tool other than `ask_user_question`, or a name the host does not offer. |
| `max_iterations`, `token_budget` | The most model iterations and tokens per request, clamped to 8 iterations and 200,000 tokens. | |
| `model` | What the agent needs from a model, never a provider or model name. `needs` lists any of `tool_calling`, `vision`, `long_context`, `reasoning`, `structured_output` and `multilingual`; `tier` is one of `fast`, `standard` or `strong` (default `standard`); `local_only` for data that must not leave the person's devices (app-wide; a task cannot relax it); `per_task` for named tasks that `AGENT.md` refers to. | An unknown need or tier (`manifest is not valid`); more than 8 `per_task` entries; a task name that is not `[a-z_]{1,32}`. |
| `background` | A request to run while the app is closed. The person grants it per app. | `true` without triggers. |
| `triggers.schedule` | Five-field cron, in local time. | Not five fields of digits and `* , / -`; more than 16 entries. |
| `triggers.events` | The app's own host-service events, in its namespace (`news.items.new`). | An event outside the app's namespace; more than 16 entries. |
| `instructions` | The agent's instructions, conventionally `AGENT.md`. | Not a `.md` path in the bundle. |
| `skills` | The skills to load, by directory name under `skills/`. | More than 16 skills, or one named twice. |

The agent's workspace follows the app/account storage scope and
`agent_workspace` setting. Its tool selection, research scope, sharing grants
and user consent remain separate from descriptive `capabilities` and
`network.hosts`; declaring a family does not add tools. On a host that offers
research/crawl tools, request the exact names in `agent.tools` and provide a
valid `research` scope. The default store-app offer does not include those
tools ([Code walkthrough](CODE-WALKTHROUGH.md#6-what-declaring-an-app-agent-enables)).

### An app with `tools.json` has an agent

OctoSense offers "Ask &lt;app&gt;" for any app that ships `tools.json`, even one with
no `agent` block. `hub check` still prints `agent none` for it, because the
`declarations:` line reports only the manifest's `agent` block. What the store's
privacy summary says about such an app depends on the App Hub revision the
store was built from:

| Store | Privacy summary for `tools.json` without `agent` |
| --- | --- |
| A store built from App Hub `main` | "Offers the host's Ask assistant for its admitted tools, only after you consent. Your conversation and tool results may be sent to your configured AI provider." and "No app-declared background assistant or automatic triggers." |
| The store in OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2 | "Runs no assistant." |

Each OctoSense build shows the summary of the App Hub revision it pins. An app
with neither `agent` nor `tools.json` gets "Runs no assistant." in every store,
and an app that declares `agent` gets "Runs an assistant limited to this app's
own data."

The reference app GitHub Notes shows the difference. Version 0.1.0 ships three
tools with `"agent": null`: `hub check` prints `agent none`, and the store in
OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2 says "Runs no assistant." Version 0.1.1
declares a `read-only` `agent` block: `hub check` prints `agent read-only`,
and every store says "Runs an assistant limited to this app's own data."

If you ship `tools.json`, also declare `agent`, and disclose the agent in the
privacy policy. If the app should have no agent, ship no `tools.json`.

### `tools.json`: the app's tools

From the [News example](../crates/app-policy/tests/fixtures/news-agent),
abridged:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "news.list",
      "description": "List collected stories, newest first, optionally for one topic or since a time.",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "topic": { "type": "string" },
          "since": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
          "limit": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 100 }
        }
      },
      "output_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "items": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object" } } },
        "required": ["items"]
      },
      "risk": "read",
      "background": true,
      "shareable": true,
      "private_data": false,
      "implemented_by": "host-service"
    },
    { "name": "news.read",         "risk": "read", "…": "…" },
    { "name": "news.topics.get",   "risk": "read", "…": "…" },
    { "name": "news.topics.set",   "risk": "act",  "…": "…" },
    { "name": "news.digest.write", "risk": "act",  "…": "…" }
  ]
}
```

The gate admits these tools. A call still needs a registered implementation
for its resolved method and actual service authorization. A namespace alone
does not create a service; use a reviewed `host_method` mapping for shared
services. Older released-host behavior is recorded separately below
([What OctoSense runs today](#what-octosense-runs-today)).

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | `<namespace>.<tool>`. The namespace is the last segment of the app's id: `news` for both `os.news` and `dev.example.news`. Each segment is `[a-z0-9_]`. OctoSense's tool broker, which registers and dispatches app tools, spells the part after the namespace with underscores for dots (`news.topics.get` becomes `topics_get`). The gate refuses a broker name over 32 characters. |
| `description` | What the tool does and when to use it, for a model. 1 to 1024 characters. |
| `input_schema`, `output_schema` | JSON Schema, with only these keywords: `type`, `title`, `description`, `properties`, `required`, `items`, `enum`, `const`, `default`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `minItems`, `maxItems`, `additionalProperties`, `format` and `pattern`. No `$ref`, no `anyOf`, `oneOf` or `allOf`, and no conditionals. At most 8 KiB and 8 levels deep. The input is an object. |
| `risk` | `read` (only reads), `act` (changes the app's own state) or `destructive` (sends, posts, shares, buys, deletes: anything past the app). Required. The tool broker's `Read`, `Act` and `Destructive` spellings are accepted. |
| `background` | The tool may run in a turn the person did not start. Default `false`. |
| `shareable` | Callers other than the app's own agent may be granted it, such as OctoSense's system agent (the device-wide agent the person talks to) and other apps' agents. Default `false`. |
| `private_data` | The result carries the person's private data. A shareable tool of a `local_only` app must say `false`; a `host_method` tool must say `true`, except one that runs `wasm.<function>`, which sees only its input. |
| `implemented_by` | `host-service`: a host service runs it. `app`: the app's own script runs it, in the open app ([Script tool execution](#script-tool-execution-script-tools-v1)). Required. |
| `host_method` | A reviewed shared-service method the tool runs on ([Map a tool to a shared service](#map-a-tool-to-a-shared-service-host_method)). Optional. |
| `outward` | Set it on an `act` tool whose call reaches outside the device (sends, posts, shares). Each call then waits for the person, as a destructive call does. Default `false`; refused on a `read` tool. |
| `auto_approvable` | A standing rule ("allow for an hour") may approve a call. Default `true`. Say `false` for deletion, payments, account or security changes and sharing outside the device, so the person approves each call as it happens. |
| `confirm` | Who asks the person before a destructive or outward call: `host` (the default, the host's approval path) or `app` (the app's own confirmation screen). `app` passes the gate only on a tool the app implements itself, and OctoSense refuses every destructive or outward call to a script tool that says `app` ([Who confirms a call](#who-confirms-a-call)). |

### Map a tool to a shared service: `host_method`

A `host_method` routes a tool to a reviewed method of a shared host service,
written `family.method`: the family is the service, such as `github` in
`github.read`. The tool keeps its own name in the app's namespace, and the
call runs as the app. The reference app [GitHub Notes](SUBMITTING.md#the-three-reference-apps)
maps its `githubnotes.read` tool to `github.read`:

```json
{
  "name": "githubnotes.read",
  "risk": "read",
  "private_data": true,
  "implemented_by": "host-service",
  "host_method": "github.read",
  "…": "…"
}
```

The gate refuses a `host_method` unless every rule holds:

| Rule | Refusal |
| --- | --- |
| The tool says `implemented_by: "host-service"`. | `host_method is only valid for implemented_by "host-service"` |
| The value is `family.method`, with `[a-z0-9_]` segments, at most 96 bytes. | `host_method must be family.method with nonempty [a-z0-9_] segments, at most 96 bytes` |
| No segment is `sheet`. | `host_method cannot target a host sheet or approve an action` |
| The method is in the table below, or is `wasm.<function>`: one of the app's own functions, one segment after `wasm.`. | `host_method "<m>" is not in the reviewed shared-service tool contract` |
| The tool's `risk` is at least the method's minimum (not for `wasm.<function>`). | `host_method "<m>" requires at least <risk> risk` |
| The tool says `"private_data": true` (not for `wasm.<function>`, which sees only its input). | `shared-service tools must declare private_data: true` |
| Family usage declarations are descriptive. | Omission does not refuse an otherwise reviewed method. |

| Family | Methods, minimum risk `read` | Methods, minimum risk `act` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github` | `github.repositories`, `github.files`, `github.read` | |
| `gcalendar` | `gcalendar.calendars`, `gcalendar.sync`, `gcalendar.refresh`, `gcalendar.cached`, `gcalendar.get`, `gcalendar.prepare` | |
| `device_calendar` | `device_calendar.permission.status`, `device_calendar.calendars.list`, `device_calendar.events.list`, `device_calendar.events.get` | |
| `mail` | `mail.compose_status` | `mail.compose` (local draft only) |
| `gmail` | `gmail.labels`, `gmail.messages`, `gmail.message`, `gmail.draft.get`, `gmail.event.status` | `gmail.draft.open`, `gmail.draft.edit`, `gmail.event.decide` |
| `glance` | `glance.list` | `glance.publish`, `glance.withdraw` |
| `auth` | `auth.backend.me`, `auth.backend.request` (declared `GET` operations only) | |
| `runtime` | `runtime.list`, `runtime.describe` | |
| `model` | `model.capabilities`, `model.video.status` | `model.image`, `model.audio`, `model.embeddings`, `model.video`, `model.video.cancel` |
| `camera` | `camera.permission.status` | |
| `microphone` | `microphone.permission.status` | |
| `location` | `location.permission.status`, `location.get` | |

App Hub admits the `device_calendar` aliases and `mail.compose` /
`mail.compose_status`; desktop RC2 implements them on macOS and compatible
Android builds, RC1 does not, and Windows and Linux compose and read a draft's
status but cannot approve a send. These aliases require `private_data: true`
and the stated risk; current policy does not require a family disclosure to
route them. Calendar permission prompts, calendar selection and event writes
are foreground-only; so are `mail.review_send` and `mail.send`. Preparing a
draft does not send it. The compatible host must check authorization again
and show its own immutable review before a person approves an external write.

`wasm.<function>` runs one of the app's own functions (`fns/*.wasm`, the
`wasm` usage disclosure), only on hosts that serve `wasm`
([Capabilities](#capabilities)): desktop RC2 on macOS and Linux, while RC1
left it disabled. RC2 implements the `auth`, `runtime`, `camera`,
`microphone`, `location`, `device_calendar` and `mail` methods above within the
[platform limits](HOST-API.md#limits).
The rules above apply to them too, `runtime.list` and `runtime.describe`
included. Admission does not configure an account, grant a permission or
add a missing API: check what the host implements with `runtime.describe`.
A tool mapped to `auth.backend.request` runs only the backend's declared
`GET` operations; a write still needs the app in the foreground and the
person's approval on the host's native review screen. Permission `request` and
`revoke`, account management and runtime ABIs such as `app_tools.dispatch@1`
have no `host_method`.

The seven media aliases above require [OctoSense #368](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/368);
desktop RC1 and RC2 include them. Current policy keeps `private_data: true`
and the method's risk requirement, without a `model` declaration gate.
Generation and embeddings may be billable,
so they and video cancellation require `act` risk and use the bounded model
service. Discovery does not prove provider entitlement; video cancellation
can fail when the remote job is already running. See the bilingual
[media contract](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/blob/main/apps/ai-providers/host-service/MEDIA.md)
for quotas and process-local job lifetime. Live provider/device validation is
not claimed by these policy aliases.

Account/business writes, sign-in, reviews and approvals have no `host_method`:
the person starts them from the app's own screen. The bounded model jobs above
are the explicit exception for model-provider submissions.

For a tool mapped to `glance.publish`, let `input_schema` accept only
`template` with `initial`, or an L0 `source` with `data`. Never accept
`script`. OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2 publishes an agent's script card
under the app's own policy, so a model-written `script` runs as your app.
Since OctoSense desktop RC1, the host refuses it with
`Agents cannot publish executable Splash; choose an admitted template with initial data, or L0 source`,
and refuses an L1 `source` too.

Source: `SHARED_HOST_METHODS` in `crates/app-policy/src/agent.rs`.

### Script tool execution (`script-tools-v1`)

A script tool is a tool with `"implemented_by": "app"`: the app's own Splash
code runs it, inside the open app. It needs a host that advertises
`app_tools.dispatch@1`, such as [desktop RC2](../README.md#download-a-compatible-host). OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2 refuses these tools with
`app_tool_unavailable`.

To add one:

1. Add `"requires": ["script-tools-v1"]` to the manifest.
2. Declare the tool in `tools.json` with its name, its schemas and
   `"implemented_by": "app"`.
3. Implement the `app_tool` hook in `main.splash`. In this example the app id
   is `dev.example.notebook`, so the tool namespace is `notebook`. An app
   cannot use `notes`, which is a reserved name
   ([Ids and reserved names](#ids-and-reserved-names)).

```splash
fn app_tool(name, call_id) {
    let request = mod.app_tools.request(call_id)
    if name == "notebook.read" {
        mod.app_tools.complete(call_id, {text: fs.read("note.txt")})
    } else {
        mod.app_tools.fail(call_id, "Unknown tool")
    }
}
```

`mod.app_tools.request(call_id)` returns `args`, the arguments after the host
has checked them against `input_schema`, and `context`, which holds `app`,
`account`, `caller` and `call_id`. The host fills in `context`; the script
cannot choose its values. Finish the call with `mod.app_tools.complete` or
`mod.app_tools.fail`. A result that does not match `output_schema` reaches the
caller as `invalid_result`. The caller gets `app_error` when the hook calls
`fail`, raises a script error or exceeds the VM's instruction limit. The host
does not enforce `pattern` or `format`.

The hook runs on the UI thread, in the same Splash VM and storage folder as
the app's screens, within the VM's instruction and memory limits. It can also
finish the call later, for example in a `host.request` callback:
`mod.app_tools.active(call_id)` says whether the call is still open. Another
app or a host sheet cannot use the `call_id` to read the arguments or finish
the call.

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Arguments, result | 1 MiB each |
| Deadline | 60 s at most |
| Open calls | 16 per app, 128 per host process |

A call ends early when the app closes (`app_not_running`), the app's account
changes (`account_scope`), the deadline passes (`timeout`) or the caller
cancels. Ending a call neither stops a hook that is already running nor undoes
what it did, and the host ignores a `complete` or `fail` that comes after the
end.

A script tool cannot:

- Run while the app is closed. The host starts neither the app nor a background
  copy of it, even for a tool with `background: true`, so the call answers
  `app_not_running`.
- Run in a Glance copy of the app or in a second open copy. Only the full app
  opened first owns the tools; a second copy gets none and shows
  `App tools unavailable: app_busy: …`.
- Raise a host sheet, such as a permission request. While any of the app's
  calls is open, the app's own screens cannot raise one either.
- Be confirmed on the app's own screen. The host refuses a destructive or
  outward call to a script tool that says `confirm: "app"`, so keep the
  default, `confirm: "host"`.
- Bypass current app admission, account scope, device consent, native review,
  resource limits or host availability. Capability-family declarations alone
  neither grant nor deny the API.

Unverified: script tools on a phone and with a real model.

### Who confirms a call

`risk` and `outward` decide whether a call needs the person; `confirm` decides
whose surface asks. Read calls, and act calls without `outward`, run
unattended. A destructive or outward call runs only after the person approves
it, live or through a standing rule:

| `risk: "destructive"` (or `outward: true`) with | Person present | Person absent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `confirm: "host"` (default) | The host's approval path asks. | An approval request in the app's conversation. |
| `confirm: "app"` | The app's own confirmation screen is the only confirmation (for example Rinx's `send_message`). The host does not ask again. | An approval request in the app's conversation. |

The person is never asked twice for one call. A destructive tool may still say
`background: true`: the gate records a warning, and the tool runs only after
approval. `confirm: "app"` on a tool that is neither destructive nor outward
confirms nothing, and the gate warns about it.

Only a native app, such as Rinx, has a confirmation screen of its own today.
In a store app, the gate refuses `confirm: "app"` on a `host-service` tool,
and OctoSense refuses a destructive or outward call to a script tool that says
`confirm: "app"` ([Script tool execution](#script-tool-execution-script-tools-v1)).
Keep the default.

### `AGENT.md` and skills

`AGENT.md` is the agent's role and instructions: what to do on each trigger,
what matters in the app's data, the rubric for its output and its rules for
memory.

A skill is an octos skill directory with `SKILL.md` and `manifest.json`. For a
store app it is data only: the skill's `manifest.json` holds `name` (its directory),
`version`, `description`, `uses` (the tools it calls, each one of the app's
tools or in `agent.tools`) and optionally `prompts.include`.

```json
{
  "name": "news-digest",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Write a cited morning or evening digest from collected stories.",
  "uses": ["news.list", "news.read", "news.digest.write"]
}
```

### Rules for agent files

The gate refuses these under the check `tools`, `agent` or `skills`:

| File | Refused when |
| --- | --- |
| `tools.json` | The file is over 64 KiB or declares no tools or more than 64; a tool is outside the app's namespace; the namespace is not `[a-z0-9_]{1,24}`; a name is duplicated; two names share a broker name; a broker name is over 32 characters; a tool lacks `name`, `description`, `input_schema`, `output_schema`, `risk` or `implemented_by`; a field is unknown; a schema uses a keyword the `input_schema` row does not list; a host-service tool says `confirm: "app"`; a `read` tool says `outward`; a shareable tool of a `local_only` app lacks `"private_data": false`; a `host_method` breaks its rules. |
| `AGENT.md` | `agent.instructions` does not name it; the text is empty, over 32 KiB, not UTF-8, holds control characters, starts with `#!` or contains `<script`, `<iframe`, `<object`, `<embed`, `javascript:`, `vbscript:` or `data:text/html`. |
| `skills/<name>/` | `agent.skills` does not name it; its manifest declares executable fields (`tools`, `binaries`, `sha256`, `mcp_servers`, `hooks`, `hardware_lifecycle`, `tool_discovery`, `actions` or `make_type`); it holds a file other than `.md`, `.json` or `.txt`, or a symlink; the manifest's `name` differs from the directory; a `uses` entry is neither one of the app's tools nor in `agent.tools`. |
| `AGENT.md` or `skills/` | The manifest has no `agent` block. |

### What the store shows

The store derives lines like these from the manifest and `tools.json`, and
shows them beside the other permissions before install:

- "Run an assistant for this app, only after you allow it" (`agent`)
- "Its assistant can use these app tools: news.list, news.read" (the tools in
  `tools.json` of an app that declares `agent`)
- "Its assistant requests these additional tools: net.fetch" (`agent.tools`
  other than `ask_user_question`)
- "Its assistant may work while the app is closed, on a schedule and when new
  data arrives; only if you allow it, and you can turn it off." (`background`)
- "Can ask to mail.send: nothing of this runs until you approve it." (a
  destructive or outward tool that the host confirms)
- "You approve every call of pay.transfer yourself: no standing rule can."
  (`auto_approvable: false`)
- "Offers news.list to other assistants you allow." (`shareable`)

The store in OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2 shows one line in place of the
first three: "Run an assistant for this app (&lt;tools&gt;), inside this
app's own data only", where &lt;tools&gt; lists only `agent.tools`. An app
whose tools are all in `tools.json` therefore gets "Run an assistant for this app
(no tools), inside this app's own data only".

### What OctoSense runs today

On OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2, each part works as follows:

| Part | Today |
| --- | --- |
| Talking to the agent | The shell's "Ask &lt;app&gt;" panel, once the person allows the app's agent. OctoSense asks at first use. `card-host` runs no agent. |
| Tools with `implemented_by: "host-service"` | Run as the app on the service that their `host_method` names, which the manifest must request. Without `host_method`, a tool calls the service named by its namespace. That works for a system app, such as `os.news`, but a store app's namespace is not a capability, so the call fails with `not_granted`. A tool call never raises a sheet. |
| Tools with `implemented_by: "app"` | Not yet: a call fails with `app_tool_unavailable`. |
| `AGENT.md` and skills | Loaded as guidance for every turn. They grant no tools. |
| `agent.tools` | `ask_user_question` works. Not yet: an executor for `ledger.read`, `ledger.write`, `net.fetch`, `storage.read`, `storage.write` or `card.render`. |
| `background` and `triggers.events` | Only the event `<namespace>.new_message`, for an app granted `gmail` and `auth`, with `background: true`, after the person allows its agent. |
| `triggers.schedule` and other events | Not yet. |
| `agent.model` | Not yet: OctoSense ignores it. |
| Glance cards from the agent | Any card the app may publish, a `script` card included. |

OctoSense desktop RC1 changed four things, and RC2 keeps them:

- Tools with `implemented_by: "app"` run in the open app
  ([Script tool execution](#script-tool-execution-script-tools-v1)).
- A tool call that publishes a Glance card (`glance.publish`, directly or
  through `host_method`) accepts only a template with an `initial` object, or
  L0 `source`. It refuses `script` and L1 source with the error kind
  `unsafe_card_source`.
- Approving a GitHub or Google Calendar save takes a physical press
  ([Connected accounts](#connected-accounts)).
- The host keeps Google Calendar events from 30 days back to 366 days ahead.

## The listing

`listing.json` is what a person sees in the store before installing. It is
reviewed with the bundle and travels in the signed catalog, so what a reviewer
read is what the store shows. The usage disclosures beside it come from the
manifest, not the listing. Both must describe actual behavior accurately;
omitted disclosures do not prove that an app cannot store data or go online.

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `schema` | `1`. |
| `subtitle` | At most 80 characters. |
| `description` | Not empty; at most 4000 characters. |
| `category` | One of `productivity`, `utilities`, `photo-video`, `news`, `weather`, `travel`, `finance`, `health`, `education`, `entertainment`, `games`, `social`, `shopping`, `lifestyle` or `developer`. |
| `keywords` | At most 10. |
| `screenshots` | 1 to 8 paths to PNG or SVG files in the bundle. Use real captures of the running app ([Capture the screenshots](SUBMITTING.md#4-capture-the-screenshots)). |
| `icon` | The path to a square PNG or SVG in the bundle ([App icons and bundled artwork](ICONS.md)). A PNG icon is at most 1 MiB and 1024 px a side. Use the same icon in the launcher. |
| `platforms` | At least one of `android`, `ios`, `macos`, `windows`, `linux`, `openharmony` or `web`. List only platforms you tested. |
| `publisher.name` | Not empty. |
| `publisher.support` | A URL or an email address. |
| `publisher.privacy_policy_url` | An `https://` URL. |
| `release_notes` | What changed in this version. |
| `age_rating` | `all`, `12+`, `16+` or `18+`. |
| `license` | An SPDX identifier, when the source is open. |

`subtitle`, `keywords`, `release_notes` and `license` are optional; every other
field is required. Unknown fields are refused. The listing is part of the
signed version: to change its text, publish a new version.

The store also shows a **privacy summary**, derived from the manifest and, in a
store built from App Hub `main`, the reviewed tools: what the app stores,
which hosts it contacts, which device features it uses and whether it runs an
agent ([An app with `tools.json` has an agent](#an-app-with-toolsjson-has-an-agent)).
Do not restate it in the description; make the manifest right instead. You
may still describe what your app agent sends, as GitHub Notes 0.1.1 does.

## Host services and sheets

A script app never holds a credential. For work that needs one, it calls a
host service:

```splash
host.request("mail.list", {…}, fn(r){ … })
```

A public call goes to the service the host registered for that family.
The host checks actual consent, app/account ownership and availability,
independently of family usage declarations. The service does the work and answers
with data, never with a credential. A connection handle it returns is opaque
and bound to the app. A call to a family that
no service answers fails at once with `no service answers "<family>" on this device`;
`card-host` registers no service; only App Hub's `runtime` discovery
answers there.
To see which shell serves which family, read
App Flow's
[Host services](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/docs/HOST-SERVICES.md).

`card-host` also implements none of the APIs that `host-api-v1`,
`backend-api-v1` and `script-tools-v1` require, so it refuses an app whose
manifest requires one of them. Test such an app in
[desktop RC1](../README.md#download-a-compatible-host), which implements
those APIs within its [platform limits](HOST-API.md#limits).

### Sheets: apps never collect secrets

Input that only the person should give, such as a password or an account
approval, goes on a **sheet**: a surface the host draws over the app, in an
isolate of its own under no app's policy. Only a service can open one. Service
methods that take a secret live under `<family>.sheet.` and are accepted only
from that sheet. An app's own password fields take no input at runtime, and
the gate refuses a bundle that declares one.

While a sheet is up, text, keys, IME input, the clipboard and pointer releases
go only to the sheet; timers and service replies still reach the app. A host
built from App Hub `main` keeps its own reference to the sheet, so an app
widget named `sheet` cannot hide or replace it.

See App Flow's
[Mail, the worked example](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/docs/HOST-SERVICES.md#mail-the-worked-example).

### Connected accounts

An app that works with GitHub or Google should disclose `auth` plus the
provider families it uses: `github`, `gcalendar` or `gmail`. These declarations
do not authorize account access. The person signs in on a host sheet, and
the app gets a connection handle, never a token. Writes go
through a host review. Set `storage.accounts: true`, so that each account keeps
its own data. For the hosts that serve these apps, see
[Before you start](SUBMITTING.md#before-you-start); for the calls, see
App Flow's [Use a connected account](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/docs/CAPABILITIES.md#use-a-connected-account).

What the host enforces depends on its build and platform. Protected writes
remain unsupported and fail closed on Windows/Linux; see
[platform limits](../README.md#download-a-compatible-host):

| | OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2 | OctoSense desktop RC1 and RC2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approving a Gmail send | A physical press on the native Approve & Send control | The same |
| Approving a GitHub or Google Calendar save | The host's review sheet, which does not check that the press is physical | A physical press on the native Approve & Save control; script and agent requests cannot approve |
| Google Calendar events the host keeps | The calendar's whole history | 30 days before today to 366 days after (UTC), with recurring events expanded |

To identify the person without reading their data, declare `auth` alone and
request only identity scopes: `read:user` for GitHub, or `openid`, `email` and
`profile` for Google. `auth.connect` then returns a connection with the
provider's `subject` and a display `label`, and grants no access to
repositories, mail or calendars.

Sign-in needs the provider's OAuth registration in the host:

| Host | Registrations come from | Without one, `auth.connect` fails with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OctoSense desktop 0.1.0-beta.2 | The host's `oauth/clients.json`, which the release does not ship | `OAuth is not configured. Add provider registrations in the host's oauth/clients.json` |
| OctoSense desktop RC1 and RC2 | Distributor build settings or a host `oauth/clients.json` override; the public RC1 and RC2 packages include no registrations | `GitHub sign-in is unavailable in this build. Check for an OctoSense update or contact its distributor.`, or the same for Google |

### Sign in to your own backend

Since OctoSense desktop RC1, the host can sign an app in to its developer's
backend and call the backend operations that the app declares, within the
[platform limits](../README.md#download-a-compatible-host). Declare the
backend in the manifest. The declaration is public and holds no credential:

```json
{
  "capabilities": ["auth"],
  "storage": { "accounts": true },
  "requires": ["backend-api-v1"],
  "backend": {
    "id": "notes",
    "client_id": "<public-client-id>",
    "authorization_url": "https://login.example.com/authorize",
    "token_url": "https://login.example.com/token",
    "me_url": "https://login.example.com/me",
    "logout_url": "https://login.example.com/logout",
    "scopes": ["app.session"],
    "operations": {
      "notes.list": { "method": "GET", "path": "/api/notes", "query_keys": ["tag"] },
      "notes.create": { "method": "POST", "path": "/api/notes" }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | 1 to 64 characters of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`. |
| `client_id` | The backend's public client id: 1 to 256 characters, with no spaces or control characters. |
| `authorization_url`, `token_url`, `me_url`, `logout_url` | Four different `https://` URLs on one origin and port 443, with no user name, password, query, fragment, `%` escape or `\`, and no `.` or `..` segment. |
| `scopes` | Exactly `["app.session"]`. |
| `operations` | Up to 64, keyed by name (`[A-Za-z0-9._-]`). Each has a `method` (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE`), an exact `path` on the same origin that is not one of the four URLs' paths, and up to 32 distinct `query_keys`. |

The manifest must set `storage.accounts: true` and require `backend-api-v1`.
Disclose `auth` use for review; 1.11 no longer requires that family to admit
the backend. The gate still validates the backend registration and account
layout. Older gates can report `backend requires auth and storage.accounts`.

At runtime, call the `auth` service:

1. `auth.connect` with `{"provider":"backend","scopes":["app.session"]}`. The
   person registers or signs in on the backend's own web page. On macOS and
   Android 9 or later, the host shows that page in its own web view, which
   stays on your login origin. On desktop, add `"presentation":"browser"` to
   use the system browser instead, as you must if the page sends the person to
   GitHub or another provider.
2. `auth.backend.me` with the returned connection handle. It answers with the
   backend's verified identity (`sub` and `label`).
3. `auth.backend.request` with the handle, an operation and its declared query
   keys, such as
   `{"connection":"<handle>","operation":"notes.list","query":{"tag":"work"}}`.
   A write also takes a JSON `body`. The host adds the session's token, calls
   the declared method and path, and answers with the backend's JSON.

A `GET` operation runs at once, even from a home-screen tile or an agent tool.
A `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` operation runs only after the person
approves the exact request on the host's native review with a physical press,
so the app must be in the foreground. From a tile or an agent tool, a write
fails with `Open the app to review this backend change`. Bodies and answers are
at most 64 KiB of JSON, and the host refuses redirects. Changing or removing
the `backend` block, updating the app or withdrawing it ends the app's backend
sessions, and the person signs in again.

Where it works:

- Only a host that implements `auth.backend.request@1` installs the app:
  desktop RC1 and RC2 advertise it on macOS, Windows and Linux; compatible
  Android source builds also implement it. Windows/Linux use external-browser
  login (RC2 adds the native link openers it needs) and declared reads;
  embedded login and protected writes are unsupported.
  A host missing the method refuses it with
  `app <id> needs a host implementing auth.backend.request@1`. iOS has no backend sign-in.
- An app without a `backend` block signs in only on devices whose operator
  registered its backend in the host's `oauth/backends.json`. Windows and Linux
  use the browser for that sign-in.
- Verified on Windows with RC2's source: a fixture completed a browser sign-in
  against a synthetic backend. Unverified: sign-in against a real backend,
  sign-in on Linux, and an approved write on a device.

What an app cannot do:

- Reach its backend any other way. It cannot choose a URL, method, header or
  token, or send a query key it did not declare, and it never sees the
  backend's tokens.
- Approve its own writes. Script and agent requests cannot approve the host's
  review.
- Collect the password itself, or reuse the host's GitHub or Google tokens.

The backend's side of the protocol is in OctoSense's
[developer backend contract](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/blob/main/crates/oauth-service/README.md#developer-backend-contract).

### Limits on host-service calls

Each call gets exactly one answer: the service's data, or an error the app can
act on.

| Limit | Value | Otherwise the app gets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time to answer | 60 s, unless the service asks for more; paused while the service's sheet is up | `the host service timed out` |
| Calls waiting per app | 32 | `too many host requests are waiting; try again when some have answered` |
| Arguments | 1 MiB of valid JSON | `the request's arguments exceed 1 MiB`, or `the request's arguments are not valid JSON: …` |
| Answer | 4 MiB | `the service's answer exceeds 4 MiB` |

When the app closes, its waiting calls end with it, and no late answer reaches
the app's next session.

### Where a sheet may appear

A service may raise a sheet only over an app in the foreground. For an app
shown as a home-screen tile, or a tool call from an agent, the host sets
`may_prompt` to `false` and refuses any sheet with
`this surface cannot raise a prompt; open the app to continue`. The `prompt`
capability does not change this.

## Commands

`hub` runs the gate's own code, so its report is the one the Hub acts on.
Build it as in App Flow's
[Quickstart](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Flow/blob/main/docs/QUICKSTART.md).
Run `hub`, `hub help` or any command with `--help` or `-h` for the usage;
none of them reads a bundle or writes a file. An unknown command fails with
``hub: unknown command "<name>"; run `hub help` for usage``.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `hub publisher-prepare/attach/verify/pack/unpack/entry` | Prepare a canonical GitHub subject, attach its proof, verify, deliver or build a review candidate; see [GitHub publisher provenance](#github-publisher-provenance) and `hub --help` for exact flags. No command publishes the catalog. |
| `hub stamp <bundle>` | Parses `manifest.json` with the gate's parser, then writes the bundle's digest into `integrity.bundle_blake3` and prints it. Refuses a manifest the gate cannot read or an already GitHub-attested release. |
| `hub check <bundle> [--allow-unsigned] [--publisher-key <id>=<hex>] [--catalog <file> [--anchor <hex>]] [--json] [--system-app] [--advisory-db <dir>]` | The gate. Prints `PASSED` or `REFUSED`, every finding, usage declarations and resolved resource limits. Exits 1 on a refusal. `--json` prints the report as JSON (`schema`, `stage`, `passed`, `app_id`, `version`, `digest`, `findings` and `resources`). `--publisher-key` checks a legacy key-signed bundle; publishing never needs it. `--advisory-db` checks the crates its components list against a RustSec checkout ([The crates a component lists](#the-crates-a-component-lists)). |
| `hub scan <bundle> [--publisher-key <id>=<hex>] [--catalog <file> [--anchor <hex>]] [--packet <out.json>] [--reviewer <cmd>] [--system-app]` | Runs the gate, then writes the review packet and optionally hands it to a reviewer command. A bundle the gate refuses gets no scan. |
| `hub component-info <file.wasm>` | Prints what a function file is (`component` or `module`), its imports and its exported functions with their parameters and results, as JSON ([WebAssembly components](#webassembly-components)). It reads only that file. A file that is neither a core module nor a valid component fails with `hub: <file>: not a WebAssembly core module or component` or the validator's error. |
| `hub component-prepare <file.wasm> --draft <component.json> --out <file>` | Describes a shared component file as a release: its digest, size, imports and exports, with your draft's fields. With `--repository`, `--repository-id`, `--owner-id`, `--workflow`, `--tag` and `--commit`, it writes the canonical subject to attest, which must be named `octosense-component.json`; without them, an unsigned development release. Never overwrites a file ([Publish a shared component](#publish-a-shared-component)). |
| `hub component-pack <release.json> --wasm <file.wasm> [--attestation <bundle.json>] [--allow-unsigned] --out <new directory>` | Attaches the proof, runs the component gate and writes `<id>-<version>.component.json` and `<id>-<version>.wasm`. Writes nothing when the gate refuses. |
| `hub component-check <release.json> --wasm <file.wasm> [--catalog <file> [--anchor <hex>]] [--allow-unsigned] [--json]` | The gate for a component release and its file. Prints `PASSED` or `REFUSED` and every finding; exits 1 on a refusal. |
| `hub component-entry <release.json> --wasm <file.wasm> --catalog <authenticated catalog> --out <index.json>` | Builds a catalog candidate's index entry for a GitHub-attested release, without publishing it. |
| `hub component-publish <release.json> --wasm <file.wasm> --catalog <file> --key <file> --anchor-cert <hex> --publisher <id> [--out <dir>] [--allow-unsigned]` | Adds a component to a legacy-signed catalog, for a local rehearsal ([Rehearse with a development hub](#rehearse-with-a-development-hub)). |
| `hub verify <catalog> --anchor <hex>` | Verifies a catalog against a trust anchor. |
| `hub keygen`, `hub pubkey`, `hub sign-manifest` | Legacy Ed25519 key tools. Maintainers use them for the legacy catalog, and a local rehearsal uses `hub keygen` for its throwaway catalog keys. Never use them to sign an app: App Hub accepts only GitHub-attested releases. [Issue #168](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/issues/168) decides whether they stay. |

`--catalog <file>` adds the `version` and `continuity` checks against a
published catalog, such as this repository's `catalog-v2.json`, and uses the
publisher identities it records. A missing file is refused. A v2 catalog must
verify against the compiled GitHub workflow policy; a legacy catalog must
verify against the Hub's anchor
([Trust anchor](../README.md#trust-anchor)), or against `--anchor <hex>` for a
development hub. Otherwise `hub check` stops with
`hub: could not authenticate base catalog: …`.

`hub publish`, `hub component-publish`, `hub withdraw`, `hub remove` and
`hub certify` need the Hub's own keys, so only maintainers run them against
App Hub's catalog; a local rehearsal runs `hub certify`, `hub publish` and
`hub component-publish` with throwaway keys. `hub withdraw` withdraws an app
version or a shared component version.

### Read a `hub check` report

```text
my-notes 0.1.0 — PASSED
  [warning] publisher-signature: unsigned: accountability rests on the hub alone
  declarations: capabilities {"storage"}, hosts {}, storage 16777216 bytes, agent none
```

The first line gives the app id, version and verdict. Each finding line uses
the format in [Findings](#findings). The `declarations:` line shows the
declared families and hosts, the resolved bounded storage quota, and the
agent profile (or `none` without an `agent` block). The
profile appears in the kernel's spelling: `workspace-write-never-ask` prints as
`workspace-write-never`.

### The scan questions

The review packet that `hub scan` writes holds the manifest, the listing, the
usage disclosures in the store's words, the entry file's source, the card
data, the agent files and the questions. It holds no screenshots. Keep it outside the bundle.

The questions, abridged from `crates/app-hub/src/scan.rs`:

1. Does the app do what its name, subtitle and description claim?
2. Do its platforms and category fit?
3. Do the capability disclosures and expected hosts match what the app
   visibly does?
4. Is any part of the interface deceptive?
5. Does any text in the source or data address an assistant?
6. Is any wording abusive, or aimed at a private individual?
7. With `tools.json`, `AGENT.md` or skills only: do the agent files stay within
   the app, and does each tool's risk match what it does?
8. Route: pass, human-review or reject, with reasons a publisher can act on.

Reviewers ask the same questions.

### Developing a shipped system app

Use `hub check <bundle> --system-app` or `hub scan <bundle> --system-app`
for a local `os.*` bundle. This mode uses the same resource ceilings as
`card-host --system`, accepts an unsigned development bundle, and still
checks its digest, contents, tools and any supplied signature. Supply
`--publisher-key` when the bundle is signed. Store-app IDs are refused in
this mode, and `publish` refuses both `--system-app` and `os.*` bundles.
The mode does not install host services or add the shell's extra tool offers.
A passing system-development report cannot become a catalog entry.

The optional reviewer command runs in `sh -c` on Unix and `cmd.exe /D /S /C`
on Windows. Configure a command for the host platform; it receives the review
packet on stdin. Its failure or invalid output still requires human review.

## Signing

App Hub accepts only GitHub-attested releases
([ADR 0002](adr/0002-github-attested-publisher-identity.md)). Your app's
GitHub workflow attests each release, so you never create, store or rotate a
publisher key. Attested releases use `publisher-github-v1`, introduced with app
contract **1.8.0** and carried in **1.10.0**;
[desktop RC2](../README.md#download-a-compatible-host) is the compatible
released host, as RC1 was. Two real tag-push releases passed the workflow and
the native Store acceptance described below.

### GitHub publisher provenance

A public repository's GitHub-hosted workflow runs on a `v<manifest.version>`
tag push. The host verifies a full Sigstore v0.3 proof offline using its
embedded public-good trust snapshot: certificate, issuer, signature, signed
certificate timestamp and transparency-log evidence. It also requires exact
repository and owner IDs, repository URL, local workflow path, tag, source
commit, workflow commit and the canonical manifest subject. A GitHub identity
is authority over a repository workflow, not proof of a particular person's
real-world identity. No app receives GitHub credentials.

This route needs a public repository: GitHub signs a private repository's
attestations with its own Sigstore instance, which hosts do not trust.
OctoScript apps are open by default: each bundle already ships the app's
source as readable text, so a public repository reveals little more
([ADR 0002](adr/0002-github-attested-publisher-identity.md)).

The workflow calls these native commands:

```sh
hub publisher-prepare bundle --repository OWNER/REPO \
  --repository-id REPOSITORY_ID --owner-id OWNER_ID \

`build/` must exist outside `bundle/`. `publisher-prepare` adds
`requires: ["publisher-github-v1"]`, records the identity in `integrity.github`
and stamps the final bundle. Canonical signing bytes include that identity
and the bundle digest, but exclude `integrity.github.attestation`. The proof
is attached afterward; the manifest is excluded from the bundle digest, so
there is no hash cycle. The proof is at most 48 KiB and the complete manifest
at most 64 KiB. Prepare refuses an already sealed release. Attach and pack
verify the final bytes and never restamp; edits require a new release proof.
The workflow uses no publisher key and no repository secret.

Validation used the public synthetic fixture's [v0.1.0 workflow](https://github.com/ymote/octosense-publisher-fixture/actions/runs/37736273522)
and [v0.1.1 workflow](https://github.com/ymote/octosense-publisher-fixture/actions/runs/37736765473),
without repository secrets. Both generated and verified real GitHub proofs.
The [native acceptance example](../crates/app-hub/examples/publisher_acceptance.rs)
then installed both release packs, prepared and validated launches, preserved
the full proofs, and refused content/proof/identity tampering, rollback,
unsigned ownership replacement and withdrawn releases. The [receipt](../reviews/github-publisher-v1/acceptance.json)
binds the input hashes and native source. Its Store catalog was an ephemeral
local test catalog; the fixture has no App Hub submission or catalog entry.
This does not establish app UI execution or phone publisher installation.

On macOS, OctoSense desktop RC1 installed the GitHub-attested sample apps in
catalog sequence 13 and checked their attestations and publisher continuity at
install and update; [RC2](../README.md#download-a-compatible-host) reads the
catalog the same way. Store
installs on iOS, Windows and Linux remain unverified, and no released phone
build supports `publisher-github-v1`.

Download the **release pack**, which contains the generated attested manifest;
a source checkout alone does not contain those final bytes. A reviewer can
run `hub publisher-unpack app.bundle.pack.json --out review-bundle`, then
`hub publisher-verify review-bundle --catalog <authenticated-catalog>`.
Unpack requires a new directory, rejects traversal and removes its own output
on failure. `hub publisher-entry review-bundle --catalog <authenticated-catalog>
--out build/index.json` produces a review candidate, without publication.

Open an **App Hub submission issue** to request publication; it can precede
the release. Add the repository, immutable tag/commit, release-pack link and
verification evidence when ready. Creating a tag or GitHub Release
does not submit, approve or list the app. Admin catalog review remains the
[separate protected publication flow](GITHUB-PUBLISHING.md).

Older hosts refuse the new marker; a host with no provenance verifier refuses
the proof even with unsigned development enabled. Standalone `card-host` has
no publisher verifier: use the editable source for its previews and
a compatible Store host for the sealed app. Admission is not app UX or device
acceptance. Publishing contract 1.8.0 alone does not ship a compatible host.

### Publisher continuity

With `--catalog`, the gate checks each release against the publisher on
record in the authenticated catalog, never against an identity or key that a
submission supplies. The catalog records a GitHub publisher as
`github:<repository_id>`, and a withdrawn release stays in that history.

| Case | Rule | Refusal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any GitHub release | `version` is a semantic version, `major.minor.patch`. | `continuity: GitHub publisher version must be semantic version major.minor.patch` |
| A first GitHub release under an id on record as unsigned or key-signed | Use a new id: GitHub provenance never takes over an id on record. | `continuity: existing legacy app ownership cannot be adopted by GitHub provenance` |
| An update | Comes from the same repository name, repository ID, owner ID and workflow path. | `continuity: GitHub publisher repository, owner or workflow changed` |
| An update | Has a higher semantic version than the latest on record. | `continuity: GitHub publisher version must advance; replay and rollback are refused` |
| An update | Carries GitHub provenance. | Unsigned or key-signed: `continuity: GitHub-owned app cannot downgrade to legacy or unsigned authentication` |

No command moves an app to another repository, owner or workflow. After the
repository is renamed, transferred or deleted, the app continues only under a
new id. Catalog history that disagrees with itself needs a maintainer: ask in
an issue.

The release proof covers the manifest, including `integrity.bundle_blake3`.
Follow these rules:

- **Test the editable source.** `card-host` refuses a sealed release with
  `this host has no GitHub publisher verifier`, and older hosts refuse its
  `publisher-github-v1` requirement. Capture screenshots and test the
  editable source; the workflow seals the release.
- **Never edit a sealed release.** Changing bundle bytes invalidates the
  digest, and changing manifest fields invalidates the proof. Instead of
  silently invalidating a sealed manifest, `hub stamp` refuses it with
  `publisher signing metadata cannot be restamped; prepare a new unsigned version`,
  and `card-host --stamp` refuses it too. Change the editable source and
  release a new version with a new tag.
- **Keep the bytes exact.** The digest covers every file except
  `manifest.json`: its path, length and bytes, with `/` between path segments
  on every platform. Line-ending conversion changes it, so keep Git from
  converting the bundle
  ([Lay out the repository](SUBMITTING.md#1-lay-out-the-repository)).

## Submitting

Submit by opening an issue, never by a pull request that edits `catalog.json`,
`index/` or `artifacts/` ([Submit an app to the App Hub](SUBMITTING.md)).

## After publication

- **Versions.** An installed app runs the installed version's reviewed
  bundle under the host's current authorization checks. A newer version is
  an update the person may take; until they do, the installed version keeps
  opening.
- **Integrity.** The host keeps the installed bundle outside the app's
  storage, so the app cannot write to it. Each launch checks it against the
  catalog: the manifest, the digest and the publisher's proof. A bundle that
  no longer matches is refused until the person reinstalls the app.
- **Withdrawal.** A withdrawn version stops running on each device's next
  catalog fetch, and other versions keep working
  ([After you submit](SUBMITTING.md#9-after-you-submit)).
